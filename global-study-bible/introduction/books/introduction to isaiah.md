## Author and Date

Isaiah was called to his prophetic ministry “in the year that King Uzziah died” ([6:1](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+6%3A1/)), around 740 b.c. He lived long enough to record the death of Sennacherib ([37:38](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+37%3A38/)), in 681. However, most of the book can be dated only in very general terms because few specific dates are given.

## Theme

The central theme of the book is God himself, who does all things for his own glory ([48:11](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+48%3A11/)). Isaiah defines everything else by how it relates to God: is it rightly related to him as the center of all reality ([45:22–25](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+45%3A22%E2%80%9325/))? God’s people find strength only as they rest in the promises of their God ([30:15](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+30%3A15/)). They find refreshment only as they delight themselves in his word ([55:1–2](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+55%3A1%E2%80%932/)). To serve his cause is their worthy devotion (ch. [62](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+62%3A1%E2%80%9312/)), but to rebel against him is endless death ([66:24](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+66%3A24/)).

## Simplified Overview of Isaiah

## Key Themes

 1. God is offended by religious practices that come from an empty heart or a careless life ([1:10–17; 58:1–12; 66:1–4](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+1%3A10%E2%80%9317%2C+58%3A1%E2%80%9312%2C+66%3A1%E2%80%934/)).

 2. God’s true people will someday become a multinational community of worship and peace that will last forever ([2:2–4; 56:3–8; 66:18–23](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+2%3A2%E2%80%934%2C+56%3A3%E2%80%938%2C+66%3A18%E2%80%9323/)). They will be the predominant culture of a new world ([14:1–2; 41:8–16; 43:3–7; 60:1–22](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+14%3A1%E2%80%932%2C+41%3A8%E2%80%9316%2C+43%3A3%E2%80%937%2C+60%3A1%E2%80%9322/)).

 3. God opposes human pride ([2:10–17; 13:11; 23:9](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+2%3A10%E2%80%9317%2C+13%3A11%2C+23%3A9/)).

 4. The foolish idols that man creates are destined for destruction ([2:20–21; 44:9–20; 46:1–7](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+2%3A20%E2%80%9321%2C+44%3A9%E2%80%9320%2C+46%3A1%E2%80%937/)).

 5. God’s judgment will reduce Israel to a remnant. From this remnant he will raise up a holy people ([1:9; 6:1–12:6; 40:1–2](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+1%3A9%2C+6%3A1%E2%80%9312%3A6%2C+40%3A1%E2%80%932/)).

 6. God sometimes judges people by making them deaf and blind to his saving word ([29:9–14](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+29%3A9%E2%80%9314/)).

 7. The only hope of the world is in one man. He is the promised Davidic king ([7:14; 9:2–7; 11:1–10](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+7%3A14%2C+9%3A2%E2%80%937%2C+11%3A1%E2%80%9310/)), the servant of the Lord ([42:1–9; 52:13–53:12](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+42%3A1%E2%80%939%2C+52%3A13%E2%80%9353%3A12/)), the anointed preacher of the gospel ([61:1–3](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+61%3A1%E2%80%933/)), and the victor over all evil ([63:1–6](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+63%3A1%E2%80%936/)).

 8. God uses everything, even human sin, for his own glory ([44:24–45:13](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+44%3A24%E2%80%9345%3A13/)).

 9. All people are called to repent of sin and trust in God alone ([12:2; 26:3–4; 32:17–18; 50:10; 66:2](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+12%3A2%2C+26%3A3%E2%80%934%2C+32%3A17%E2%80%9318%2C+50%3A10%2C+66%3A2/)).

10. Often, when God’s people feel abandoned by him ([40:27](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+40%3A27/)), they foolishly trust in worldly powers ([31:1–3; 39:1–8](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+31%3A1%E2%80%933%2C+39%3A1%E2%80%938/)).

11. God will vindicate his cause with a world-transforming display of his glory ([11:10; 40:3–5; 52:10; 59:19](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+11%3A10%2C+40%3A3%E2%80%935%2C+52%3A10%2C+59%3A19/)).

12. God is guiding all of human history ([41:1–4; 44:6–8; 46:8–11](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+41%3A1%E2%80%934%2C+44%3A6%E2%80%938%2C+46%3A8%E2%80%9311/)).

13. God’s faithfulness and the certainty of his final victory should motivate his people to pray and to be obedient ([56:1–2; 62:1–64:12](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+56%3A1%E2%80%932%2C+62%3A1%E2%80%9364%3A12/)).

14. The wrath of God is to be feared above all else ([9:19; 13:9, 13; 30:27; 34:2; 66:15–16](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+9%3A19%2C+13%3A9%2C+13%3A13%2C+30%3A27%2C+34%3A2%2C+66%3A15%E2%80%9316/)).
