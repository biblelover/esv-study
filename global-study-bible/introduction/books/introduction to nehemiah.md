## Author and Date

Nehemiah is the central figure in the book. It contains some of his own records, but he is not the author of the entire book. The same author probably wrote Nehemiah and portions of Ezra. Nehemiah arrived in Jerusalem in 445 b.c., 13 years after Ezra arrived. He returned for a further visit sometime between 433 and 423 b.c. He may have made several journeys between Persian capitals and Jerusalem in this period of 20 years (see [chart](https://www.esv.org/resources/esv-global-study-biblehttps://www.esv.org/chart_16_01/)).

## Theme

The theme of Nehemiah is the Lord’s protection of his people and their need to be faithful in worship and in keeping the Mosaic law.

## Purpose and Background

The basic purpose and background of Nehemiah are the same as that for Ezra (see [Introduction to Ezra](https://www.esv.org/resources/esv-global-study-biblehttps://www.esv.org/introduction-to-ezra/#introduction-to-ezra)). Ezra, “a scribe skilled in the Law of Moses” ([Ezra 7:6](https://www.esv.org/Ezra+7%3A6/)), called the returning exiles back to covenant loyalty and obedience to the law. Nehemiah rebuilt the city walls so that the community could be protected from enemies who might take advantage of them.

## Key Themes
1. The Lord hears prayer ([1:4–6](https://www.esv.org/Nehemiah+1%3A4%E2%80%936/)). 1. The Lord works providentially, especially through powerful rulers, to bring about his greater purposes (e.g., [2:8](https://www.esv.org/Nehemiah+2%3A8/)). 1. The Lord protects his people. Because of this, they need not be afraid ([4:14](https://www.esv.org/Nehemiah+4%3A14/)). 1. The Lord is merciful and faithful to his promises despite his people’s ongoing sin ([9:32–35](https://www.esv.org/Nehemiah+9%3A32%E2%80%9335/)). 1. Worship is at the center of the life of God’s people. It includes the willing, joyful giving of resources ([10:32–39](https://www.esv.org/Nehemiah+10%3A32%E2%80%9339/)). 1. God’s people need to be on their guard against their own moral weakness (ch. [13](https://www.esv.org/Nehemiah+13%3A1%E2%80%9331/)).

## The Persian Empire at the Time of Nehemiah

#### c. 450 b.c.

During the time of Nehemiah, the Persian Empire had reached its greatest extent, engulfing nearly the entire Near East. In 539 b.c. the Persians under Cyrus the Great defeated the Babylonians and absorbed the lands of Israel and Judah (which they called “Beyond the River”) into their empire. The next year Cyrus allowed the people of Judah (now called Jews) to return home and rebuild the temple of the Lord. Several waves of returning Jews resettled in Judea. In about 445 b.c., Nehemiah was granted permission to rebuild Jerusalem’s ruined walls.
