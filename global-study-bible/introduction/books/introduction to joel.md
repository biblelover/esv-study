## Author and Date

Little is known about Joel, a prophet from Judah (perhaps Jerusalem). Most scholars date the book after the exile to Babylon (586 b.c.).

## Background

Joel calls the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem to lament and return to the Lord during a time of national disaster. A locust plague has destroyed both wine ([1:5, 7, 12](https://www.esv.org/Joel+1%3A5%2C+1%3A7%2C+1%3A12/)) and grain ([1:10](https://www.esv.org/Joel+1%3A10/)). This threatens the people’s ability to present offerings in the temple ([1:9, 13, 16](https://www.esv.org/Joel+1%3A9%2C+1%3A13%2C+1%3A16/)).

## Key Themes
1. **Day of the Lord**. The dominant theme of the book is the “day of the Lord.” This describes a time when the presence of the Lord brings judgment andhttps://www.esv.org/or deliverance and blessing, depending on the circumstances. Therefore, although the “day” results in destruction for the nations, it can also be seen as a time of salvation for God’s people. The Lord remains a refuge in the chaos of judgment ([3:15–16](/Joel+3%3A15%E2%80%9316https://www.esv.org/)). 1. **Repentance**. If the whole community would cry out to the Lord ([1:13–20](/Joel+1%3A13%E2%80%9320https://www.esv.org/)) and look to him—not merely with external actions but in sincerity and commitment ([2:12–13](/Joel+2%3A12%E2%80%9313https://www.esv.org/))—then judgment may be prevented. However, the Lord is not bound by the acts of the community ([2:14](/Joel+2%3A14https://www.esv.org/)). It is his decision to either send or withhold the destruction by the locusts ([1:15](/Joel+1%3A15https://www.esv.org/)), just as the army is his to command ([2:11](/Joel+2%3A11https://www.esv.org/)). 1. **The Lord in their midst**. The reason the Lord will turn from judgment to blessing is to express his covenant-keeping character ([2:13, 18–26; 3:18](/Joel+2%3A13%2C+2%3A18%E2%80%9326%2C+3%3A18https://www.esv.org/)). His promise to dwell in the midst of his people is prominent not only in [Joel](/Joel+1%3A1%E2%80%933%3A21https://www.esv.org/) ([2:27; 3:17, 21](/Joel+2%3A27%2C+3%3A17%2C+3%3A21https://www.esv.org/)) but also throughout the OT ([Num. 35:34](/Numbers+35%3A34https://www.esv.org/); [Isa. 12:6](/Isaiah+12%3A6https://www.esv.org/); [Zeph. 3:15, 17](/Zephaniah+3%3A15%2C+3%3A17https://www.esv.org/); [Zech. 2:10–11](/Zechariah+2%3A10%E2%80%9311https://www.esv.org/)). God restores what the locusts have destroyed ([Joel 2:27](/Joel+2%3A27https://www.esv.org/)) and protects Israel as the world crumbles ([3:16–17](/Joel+3%3A16%E2%80%9317https://www.esv.org/)) so that the people will know his presence. This theme is restated at the end of the book ([3:21](/Joel+3%3A21https://www.esv.org/)), showing how important it was for Joel. 1. These three themes come together in the **promise of the future outpouring of the Spirit **([2:28–32](/Joel+2%3A28%E2%80%9332https://www.esv.org/)). This outpouring is associated with the day of the Lord ([2:31](/Joel+2%3A31https://www.esv.org/)) in both its judgmental ([2:30–31](/Joel+2%3A30%E2%80%9331https://www.esv.org/); see [2:10; 3:15](/Joel+2%3A10%2C+3%3A15https://www.esv.org/)) and its saving ([2:32](/Joel+2%3A32https://www.esv.org/)) roles. The outpouring of the Spirit is also related to repentance: those who are saved call “on the name of the Lord” ([2:32](/Joel+2%3A32https://www.esv.org/)). The giving of the Spirit is the ultimate evidence of God “in the midst of” his people ([Isa. 63:11](/Isaiah+63%3A11https://www.esv.org/); see [Hag. 2:5](/Haggai+2%3A5/)).

## The Setting of Joel

#### c. 500 b.c.?

Though there is much debate about the date of Joel’s prophecies, it is likely that they occurred during a national calamity sometime after Judah returned from exile in Babylon.
