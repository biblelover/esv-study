## Author, Date, and Recipients

The apostle Paul wrote this letter to the churches in Ephesus and the surrounding region c. a.d. 62 while imprisoned in Rome ([Acts 28](https://www.esv.org/Acts+28%3A1%E2%80%9331/)). During this time he also wrote [Colossians](https://www.esv.org/Colossians+1%3A1%E2%80%934%3A18/) and Philemon. All three letters were sent with Tychicus and Onesimus.

## Theme

There are three main themes of [Ephesians](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+1%3A1%E2%80%936%3A24/): ([1](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+1%3A1%E2%80%9323/)) Christ has reconciled all creation to himself and to God; ([2](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+2%3A1%E2%80%9322/)) Christ has united people from all nations to himself and to one another in his church; and ([3](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+3%3A1%E2%80%9321/)) Christians must live as new people.

## Purpose

[Ephesians](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+1%3A1%E2%80%936%3A24/) offers general instruction in the truths of God’s redemptive work in Christ; the unity of the church among diverse peoples; and proper conduct in the church, the home, and the world.

## Key Themes
1. All people are by nature spiritually dead. They disobey God’s law and are ruled by Satan ([1:7; 2:1–3, 5, 11–12](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+1%3A7%2C+2%3A1%E2%80%933%2C+2%3A5%2C+2%3A11%E2%80%9312/)). 1. God predestined his people to redemption and holiness in Christ ([1:3–14; 2:4, 8–9](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+1%3A3%E2%80%9314%2C+2%3A4%2C+2%3A8%E2%80%939/)). 1. God’s rich mercy in Christ has saved sinners. This free gift is by grace through faith alone ([1:7–8; 2:4–14](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+1%3A7%E2%80%938%2C+2%3A4%E2%80%9314/)). 1. Jesus’ saving work was part of redeeming a fallen creation for God. For this he deserves glory, honor, and authority in this age and the next ([1:15–23; 3:1–13](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+1%3A15%E2%80%9323%2C+3%3A1%E2%80%9313/)). 1. Jesus unites Jews and Gentiles into his one body, the church, as a new creation ([1:23; 2:10–22; 3:1–21; 4:1–6](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+1%3A23%2C+2%3A10%E2%80%9322%2C+3%3A1%E2%80%9321%2C+4%3A1%E2%80%936/)). 1. Christ’s people are saved to new lives of holiness in thought, word, and deed. They must reject their old, sinful lifestyles ([4:1–3, 17–32; 5:1–20](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+4%3A1%E2%80%933%2C+4%3A17%E2%80%9332%2C+5%3A1%E2%80%9320/)). 1. Holiness in life includes submission to proper authorities, in home and family life, and those in authority must care for those in submission to them ([5:21–6:9](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+5%3A21%E2%80%936%3A9/)). 1. Jesus has given powerful gifts to his church. These bring unity, maturity, and defense against the devil and his allies ([4:7–16; 6:10–19](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+4%3A7%E2%80%9316%2C+6%3A10%E2%80%9319/)).

## The Setting of Ephesians

#### c. a.d. 62

Ephesus was a wealthy port city in the Roman province of Asia. It was a center of learning and was near several key land routes. Paul probably wrote his letter to the Ephesians while under house arrest in Rome ([Acts 28](https://www.esv.org/Acts+28%3A1%E2%80%9331/)).
