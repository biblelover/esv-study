# Korah Profile

## Korah

**Korah**, who was from the tribe of Levi, led a rebellion against Moses and Aaron. Dathan, Abiram, and 250 well-known chiefs of the congregation joined with him. Korah and his men accused Moses and Aaron of exalting themselves above the people of Israel. They failed to recognize, however, that it is God who gives authority to whomever he chooses. As punishment for their rebellion, Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, together with their households and possessions, were swallowed up by the earth in front of the people of Israel. God sent fire to consume the 250 chiefs. The people of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron and remained sympathetic to the punished rebels, so God sent a plague as further punishment. **([Numbers 16:31â€“35](https://www.esv.org/Numbers+16%3A31%E2%80%9335/))**
