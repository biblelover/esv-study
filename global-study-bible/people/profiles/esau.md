# Esau Profile

## Esau

**Esau**, whose name means “hairy,” was the son of Isaac and Rebekah and the elder twin brother of Jacob. Esau was a skillful hunter and his father’s favorite son, but he brought misery upon his parents by marrying two Hittite women. Esau carelessly sold his birthright to Jacob for a bowl of stew. Jacob then tricked Isaac into giving him the blessing intended for his brother. In response, Esau tried to kill Jacob. Years later, however, Jacob and Esau were reconciled. Esau founded the nation of Edom, which became an enemy of Israel. Jacob the chosen one and Esau the one not chosen typify the age-long struggle between the people of God and their adversaries. **([Genesis 27:36](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+27%3A36/))**
