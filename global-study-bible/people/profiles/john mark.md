# John Mark Profile

## John Mark

**John Mark** was probably Barnabas’s cousin ([Col. 4:10](https://www.esv.org/Colossians+4%3A10/)). The early church at Jerusalem met at the home of his mother, Mary ([Acts 12:12](https://www.esv.org/Acts+12%3A12/)). He accompanied Paul and Barnabas on their first missionary journey, but then chose to leave them. As a result, Paul refused to take him along on his second expedition. However, it seems that Mark eventually regained Paul’s favor ([2 Tim. 4:11](https://www.esv.org/2+Timothy+4%3A11/)). He ultimately demonstrated his effectiveness and commitment as a missionary pioneer and as the author of the Gospel of Mark. He was closely associated with the apostle Peter, who refers to Mark as his “son” ([1](https://www.esv.org/Acts+1%3A1%E2%80%9326/) Pet. [5:13](https://www.esv.org/Acts+5%3A13/)). **([2 Timothy 4:11](https://www.esv.org/2+Timothy+4%3A11/))**
