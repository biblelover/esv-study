## Melchizedek

**Melchizedek** is among the most mysterious figures in Scripture. King of Salem, a city identified with Jerusalem, and “priest of God Most High,” Mel­chiz­edek’s name means “king of righteousness.” Following Abraham’s defeat of Chedorlaomer and his rescue of Lot, Melchizedek provided a meal of bread and wine for Abraham and his men. He then blessed Abraham, attributing Abraham’s victory over his enemies to God Most High. In response to Melchizedek’s blessing, Abraham gave the priest-king a tenth of everything he had. David mentions Melchizedek in the messianic [Psalm 110](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+110%3A1%E2%80%937/), and the writer of [Hebrews](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+1%3A1%E2%80%9313%3A25/) presents Melchizedek as a foreshadowing of Jesus Christ, who is both priest and king. **([Genesis 14:18–20](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+14%3A18%E2%80%9320/))**
