# Nebuchadnezzar Profile

## Nebuchadnezzar

**Nebuchadnezzar** was the powerful King of Babylon who destroyed Jerusalem and deported a number of the city’s inhabitants to his own land. When the king had a dream that only Daniel could interpret, he acknowledged the power of Daniel’s God. The mighty king had to be brought very low, however, before he turned to the Lord. After failing to heed a warning from God, Nebuchadnezzar was forced to live in the wilderness, where he ate grass and lived like an animal. At the end of God’s appointed time of judgment, however, Nebuchadnezzar turned to the Lord and he regained his sanity. God restored his kingdom to him, demonstrating that the Lord is able to humble the proud and exalt the humble. The great and mighty persecutor of Israel, the destroyer of Jerusalem, was humbled by God’s grace and brought to confess God’s mercy. **([Daniel 4:28–37](https://www.esv.org/Daniel+4%3A28%E2%80%9337/))**
