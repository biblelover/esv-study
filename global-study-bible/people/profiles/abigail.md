# Abigail Profile

## Abigail

**Abigail** was the wife of Nabal, a wealthy but extremely foolish man. Nabal insulted David by refusing to care for and feed David and his men. His rudeness made David very angry, but Abigail wisely convinced David not to take vengeance. She sent food to David and spoke humbly and respectfully to him. Abigail calmed David’s anger and persuaded him not to kill her wicked husband and his household. Impressed by Abigail’s wisdom and discernment, David blessed Abigail and sent her home in peace. When she told Nabal what had happened, his “heart died within him” ([25:37](https://www.esv.org/1+Samuel+25%3A37/)). A few days later, the Lord struck Nabal and he died. Following his death, David married Abigail. **([1 Samuel 25:32–35](https://www.esv.org/1+Samuel+25%3A32%E2%80%9335/))**
