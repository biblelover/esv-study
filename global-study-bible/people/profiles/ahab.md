# Ahab Profile

## Ahab

**Ahab**, the son and successor of King Omri, reigned over Israel for 22 years. Ahab married a Phoenician princess named Jezebel, who persuaded her husband and all of Israel to worship Baal. Ahab even built a house and altar for Baal. He was confronted by the prophet Elijah, who challenged Ahab and the prophets of Baal to a “contest” on Mount Carmel ([18:20–40](https://www.esv.org/1+Kings+18%3A20%E2%80%9340/)). The Lord repeatedly revealed himself to Ahab through prophets despite Ahab’s idolatry. When Elijah prophesied the destruction of Ahab’s family, Ahab briefly humbled himself before the Lord and found mercy, only to return to his old ways afterward. Ahab’s reign was marked by conflict with Ben-hadad of Syria, whom he defeated in battle twice. **([1 Kings 21:25](https://www.esv.org/1+Kings+21%3A25/))**
