## Joash

**Joash** (also spelled Jehoash) was just an infant when his father, King Ahaziah of Judah, was murdered. Following the king’s death, Joash’s wicked grandmother Athaliah tried to kill everyone in the royal family so that she could claim the throne. Joash was spared when his aunt, Jehosheba, hid him in the temple. When Joash was seven years old, Jehoiada, the chief priest, revealed that the young boy was alive. Joash was proclaimed king, and Athaliah was put to death. Joash was a good king as long as Jehoiada was there to guide him. Probably his greatest achievement was making some much-needed repairs to the temple. After Jehoiada died, however, Joash listened to ungodly advice and disobeyed the Lord. His life ended tragically as he was murdered by his own men. **([2 Kings 12:1–3](https://www.esv.org/2+Kings+12%3A1%E2%80%933/))**
