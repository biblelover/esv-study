## Zephaniah

The name **Zephaniah** means “Yahweh has hidden.” This is significant in regards to both the prophet’s background and his message. The name probably shows that Zephaniah’s parents were faithful followers of God. Zephaniah was also the great-great-grandson of the godly king Hezekiah ([1:1](https://www.esv.org/Zephaniah+1%3A1/)). Like the prophets Joel and Amos, he prophesied about the coming “day of the Lord” when God would judge his enemies and bless his followers. Zephaniah urged the people of Judah to seek the Lord so that they would be “hidden” from his anger on that day ([2:3](https://www.esv.org/Zephaniah+2%3A3/)). Though even God’s own people would be judged, at the same time the Lord would preserve a faithful remnant. The book of [Zephaniah](https://www.esv.org/Zephaniah+1%3A1%E2%80%933%3A20/) ends with the promise that, through this remnant, Israel will be restored and the knowledge of God will be brought to all nations. **([Zephaniah 3:9–13](https://www.esv.org/Zephaniah+3%3A9%E2%80%9313/))**
