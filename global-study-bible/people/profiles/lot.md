## Lot

Abraham’s nephew **Lot** traveled with him to the promised land of Canaan. When the combined wealth of Abraham and Lot proved too much for one place, Abraham generously offered his nephew first choice of the land. Lot chose the fertile Jordan Valley, settling in Sodom. Later, Abraham rescued Lot when he was taken captive by invaders. When the wicked city of Sodom was destroyed, God allowed Lot’s family to escape. Lot’s wife disobeyed by looking back, however, and was turned into a pillar of salt. Filled with fear, Lot and his daughters hid in a cave. Both daughters, desperate to have children, tricked Lot into fathering a son with them. Despite his shortcomings, Lot is described in [2 Pet. 2:7–10](https://www.esv.org/2+Peter+2%3A7%E2%80%9310/) as a righteous man. **([Genesis 19:15–16](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+19%3A15%E2%80%9316/))**
