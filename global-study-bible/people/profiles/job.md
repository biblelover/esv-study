## Job

**Job** was a wealthy man whom the Bible describes as “blameless and upright” ([1:1](https://www.esv.org/Job+1%3A1/)). When God pointed out Job’s faithfulness, Satan responded that Job feared God only because the Lord had protected and blessed him. To test Job’s integrity, God allowed Satan to take away all of Job’s possessions and his children. In a single day Job lost everything, yet he responded faithfully ([1:21](https://www.esv.org/Job+1%3A21/)). Next God gave Satan permission to attack Job’s health. He struck Job with painful sores ([2:7](https://www.esv.org/Job+2%3A7/)). Job’s wife then urged him to “curse God and die” ([2:9](https://www.esv.org/Job+2%3A9/)). Job’s friends wrongly concluded that his sins caused his suffering, but Job refused to accept this. Instead, Job asked God to explain why he was suffering. God eventually answered Job’s cries, and Job humbly submitted to God’s sovereignty. The Lord then restored Job’s fortune, giving him “twice as much as he had before” ([42:10](https://www.esv.org/Job+42%3A10/)), and blessed him with more children. **([Job 19:25](https://www.esv.org/Job+19%3A25/))**
