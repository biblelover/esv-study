## Habakkuk

**Habakkuk** was alarmed by the wickedness of his people, the nation of Judah. He longed for the day when the Lord would bring justice to his nation by punishing sin. He was even more troubled, however, when he learned that the Lord would indeed judge Judah but that he would use the much more wicked nation of Babylon to do so. The book of [Habakkuk](https://www.esv.org/Habakkuk+1%3A1%E2%80%933%3A19/) records the prophet’s conversation with God about this perplexing issue. By the end of the book, Habakkuk is convinced that God is sovereign and that his justice is far beyond comprehension. The prophet will wait for and trust in God. Habakkuk’s faith serves as an example to believers today, who like the prophet are called to trust that the God of justice will indeed accomplish his purposes for the world. **([Habakkuk 3:17–19](https://www.esv.org/Habakkuk+3%3A17%E2%80%9319/))**
