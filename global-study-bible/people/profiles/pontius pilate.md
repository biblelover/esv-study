## Pontius Pilate

**Pontius Pilate** was the Roman governor of Judea during the ministry of Jesus. This position meant that he was the only person who could either pardon a prisoner or sentence him to death. When Jesus was brought before him for judgment, Pilate recognized that Jesus was innocent and was amazed that Jesus refused to defend himself. Even Pilateâ€™s wife saw that Jesus was innocent, and warned her husband not to get involved in the case. Pilate was also aware that the Jewish leaders had turned Jesus over to him because they felt threatened by his popularity and his authoritative ministry. Despite all of these warning signs, Pilate gave in to the crowds and handed Jesus over to be crucified. **([Mark 15:15](https://www.esv.org/Mark+15%3A15/))**
