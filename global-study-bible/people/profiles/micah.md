## Micah

Rather than being identified by his father or family, **Micah** is identified by a location: he is called “Micah of Moresheth” ([1:1](https://www.esv.org/Micah+1%3A1/)). The town was 22 miles (35 km) southwest of Jerusalem. Micah’s call to prophetic ministry is not recorded, and he is never referred to as “prophet,” but he is said to be speaking according to the “Spirit of the Lord” ([3:8](https://www.esv.org/Micah+3%3A8/)). The name “Micah” means “Who is like Yahweh?” Similarly, at the end of the book, Micah asks, “Who is a God like you?” ([7:18](https://www.esv.org/Micah+7%3A18/)). Both Micah’s name and his writings emphasize the matchless character and actions of the Lord. Micah announces God’s judgment on Israel for its unfaithfulness, yet he also proclaims God’s promise of great blessing through a Messiah—a prophecy fulfilled in Jesus Christ ([5:1–15](https://www.esv.org/Micah+5%3A1%E2%80%9315/); [Eph. 1:3–14](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+1%3A3%E2%80%9314/)). **([Micah 6:8](https://www.esv.org/Micah+6%3A8/))**
