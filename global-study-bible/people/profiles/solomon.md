## Solomon

The son of David and Bathsheba, **Solomon** succeeded his father as king of Israel. Rather than ask God for riches or power, Solomon asked for wisdom. His request pleased God, who granted him not only what he asked for but also what he did not ask—riches and honor such as the world had never known. Among the king’s most significant building projects were the first temple in Jerusalem and a magnificent palace. But riches and wisdom were not the only things Solomon had in abundance—he also had over 700 wives! He was a great king when he obeyed God, but sadly his marriages to women outside the people of God proved to be his downfall. Solomon’s reign ended in tragedy when “his wives turned away his heart” ([11:3](https://www.esv.org/1+Kings+11%3A3/)) by influencing him to worship pagan gods. **([1 Kings 3:10–14](https://www.esv.org/1+Kings+3%3A10%E2%80%9314/))**
