## Michal

Saul’s daughter **Michal** loved David, and Saul hoped to use this to his advantage. Saul offered David the right to marry Michal, but he asked for a very unusual “bride-price” which he assumed would lead to David’s death ([1 Sam. 18:20–25](https://www.esv.org/1+Samuel+18%3A20%E2%80%9325/)). The scheme didn’t work, and Michal became David’s wife. When Saul once again tried to kill David, Michal warned him and helped him escape. Saul then gave Michal to another man even though she was still married to David. After Saul’s death, David arranged for Michal to be returned to him. But the story of David and Michal had a sad ending. When David brought the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem, he celebrated by dancing before the Lord. This caused Michal to despise him, and she remained childless throughout her life. **([2 Samuel 6:16–19](https://www.esv.org/2+Samuel+6%3A16%E2%80%9319/))**
