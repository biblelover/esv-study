## Elijah

**Elijah**, one of the greatest prophets of the OT, ministered in the northern kingdom of Israel. He prophesied against the wicked king Ahab, who along with his wife Jezebel promoted Baal worship throughout Israel and persecuted the prophets of the Lord. Elijah challenged Ahab and the prophets of Baal to a contest on Mount Carmel. He instructed the prophets of Baal to call upon their gods to send down fire from heaven. In an almost humorous way, the Bible records the prophets’ utter failure to get a response from their false god. When Elijah called upon the Lord, however, he sent fire from heaven to consume his altar. Following their humiliating defeat, Elijah slaughtered all 450 of the prophets of Baal. Elijah did not die, but rather was carried into heaven by chariots and horses of fire, as his successor, Elisha, watched. **([1 Kings 18:36–40](https://www.esv.org/1+Kings+18%3A36%E2%80%9340/))**
