# Caiaphas Profile

## Caiaphas

**Caiaphas** was the high priest during Jesus’ ministry. He consulted frequently with his powerful father-in-law, Annas, who had previously served as high priest. After Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead, the chief priests and Pharisees gathered in great fear to discuss Jesus’ growing influence among the Jews. As they contemplated what to do, Caiaphas unwittingly prophesied that Jesus would die for the sins of the world ([11:51–52](https://www.esv.org/John+11%3A51%E2%80%9352/)). It was this prophecy that put in motion the plan to have Jesus put to death. When Jesus was arrested before his crucifixion, he was sent first to Annas and then to Caiaphas. As high priest and leader of the Sanhedrin, Caiaphas confirmed the charges against Jesus before handing him over to Pilate to be crucified. **([John 11:49–52](https://www.esv.org/John+11%3A49%E2%80%9352/))**
