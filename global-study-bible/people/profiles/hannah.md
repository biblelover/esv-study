## Hannah

**Hannah** was one of Elkanah’s two wives. Although his other wife, Peninnah, had children, Hannah did not. While at the temple in Shiloh, Hannah wept bitterly because of her inability to have a child. Deeply distressed, she prayed to the Lord. She vowed that if he gave her a son, she would dedicate the child to God. Eli the priest observed Hannah praying and thought that she was drunk. When he realized that her display of emotion was genuine, however, he blessed Hannah. God answered Hannah’s prayer, and she gave birth to Samuel. When the child was weaned, she took him to Eli at the temple in fulfillment of her vow. Hannah’s song, praising God for her new son, is very similar to the prayer of Mary in [Luke 1:46–55](https://www.esv.org/Luke+1%3A46%E2%80%9355/) as she looked forward to the birth of her son Jesus. **([1 Samuel 1:9–11](https://www.esv.org/1+Samuel+1%3A9%E2%80%9311/))**
