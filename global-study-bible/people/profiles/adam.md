# Adam Profile

## Adam

**Adam**, whose name means “man,” was the first human being. Created out of dust, he was made in the image of God. Adam was given dominion over the rest of creation and was placed in the garden of Eden to care for it. God created Eve as a helper for Adam, and together they enjoyed perfect fellowship with their Creator. But Adam and Eve chose to disobey God, which brought sin and death into the world. Because of their sin, all humans are now born sinners and will someday die. The Bible tells the story of how God redeems his creation from the curse of Adam’s sin. “For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive” ([1 Cor. 15:22](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+15%3A22/)). **([Genesis 2:7](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+2%3A7/))**
