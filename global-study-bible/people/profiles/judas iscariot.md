## Judas Iscariot

**Judas Iscariot** was one of the original 12 apostles. The literal meaning of the name **Iscariot** is “man of Kerioth”; if Judas was in fact from this town, located near Hebron, then he was the only apostle from Judea. As treasurer for the disciples, Judas regularly helped himself to whatever was in the moneybag. For the price of 30 pieces of silver, Judas betrayed Jesus to the chief priests, which led to Jesus being crucified. Overcome with regret, Judas later returned the money and then hanged himself. Following his death, he was replaced as an apostle by Matthias. **([Mark 14:43-45](https://www.esv.org/Mark+14%3A43%E2%80%9345/))**
