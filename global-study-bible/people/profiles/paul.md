## Paul

Author of 13 out of the 27 NT books, **Paul** is one of the most important people in the history of the Christian faith. Born in Tarsus with the Hebrew name “Saul,” he was both a Jew and a Roman citizen. He came to Jerusalem as a young man to be educated by Gamaliel, the most famous rabbinic scholar of that time. After approving the stoning of Stephen, Saul helped lead a great persecution against the church ([8:1–3](https://www.esv.org/Acts+8%3A1%E2%80%933/)). Then, on his way to Damascus to arrest believers, he was dramatically converted to the faith ([9:1–31](https://www.esv.org/Acts+9%3A1%E2%80%9331/)). Paul would eventually go on three missionary journeys, winning many people to faith in Christ and establishing churches in cities all across the Roman Empire. He was especially effective in explaining the gospel to Gentiles. Paul faced brutal opposition throughout his ministry and eventually was imprisoned. He wrote many of his letters while under house arrest and later in prison in Rome, before being martyred for his faith. **([Acts 9:1–22](https://www.esv.org/Acts+9%3A1%E2%80%9322/))**
