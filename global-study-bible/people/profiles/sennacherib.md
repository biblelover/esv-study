## Sennacherib

**Sennacherib** became king of the powerful Assyrian Empire following the death of his father, Sargon II. After defeating Babylon, Sennacherib began attacking the area of Syria and Palestine. His official records claim that he captured 46 strong-walled cities in Israel. Following a major victory at Lachish, he laid siege to Jerusalem. Sennacherib forced Hezekiah to pay a huge tribute. He mocked God, urging Hezekiah to turn his back on the Lord. Instead, Hezekiah prayed for God’s deliverance. God answered the king’s prayer, and the siege of Jerusalem was broken when the angel of the Lord killed 185,000 Assyrians in a single night. Sennacherib withdrew and returned to Nineveh, only to be killed by his own sons as he worshiped in the temple of the false god Nisroch. **([2 Kings 19:35–37](https://www.esv.org/2+Kings+19%3A35%E2%80%9337/))**
