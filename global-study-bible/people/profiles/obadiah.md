## Obadiah

The only thing known about the prophet **Obadiah** is his name, which means “one who serves Yahweh.” The book of [Obadiah](https://www.esv.org/Obadiah+1%E2%80%9321/) is an indictment against the nation of Edom, who took advantage of Judah during the Babylonian crisis. Rather than come to Judah’s aid, the Edomites gloated over the nation’s demise, looted valuables, and sold captives as slaves. Their actions were particularly shameful since the Edomites were descendants of Esau and thus brothers to the people of Judah. Edom is the target of Obadiah’s prophecy of doom because it is a shameful example of hostility toward God’s people. Even though Jerusalem’s fall was a result of the nation’s unfaithfulness—and Edom was one of God’s tools for bringing judgment—the Lord punished those who oppose his people. **([Obadiah 10–11](https://www.esv.org/Obadiah+10%E2%80%9311/))**
