## Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar

After the Lord allowed Satan to afflict Job, three of his friends, **Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar**, came to comfort him. However, all three wrongly assumed that Job’s suffering was the result of some hidden sin. Each man urged Job to repent so that God would have mercy on him. But Job insisted that he was innocent. Although it is true that some suffering is a result of sin, Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar oversimplified this truth. They believed that all troubles are punishments for wrongdoing, which was not the case for Job. The wrong actions of Job’s three friends should remind believers today to be wise and sensitive when dealing with people in distress. The Lord rebuked Job’s three friends and instructed Job to pray for them. **([Job 42:7–9](https://www.esv.org/Job+42%3A7%E2%80%939/))**
