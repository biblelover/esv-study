# Joab Profile

## Joab

**Joab** was the commander of David’s army. He was a complicated person, showing both strong faith and chilling ruthlessness in battle. In retaliation for the death of his brother Asahel, Joab murdered Abner, Saul’s general. He helped to bring about David’s reconciliation with Absalom. But later, after Absalom rebelled against David, Joab killed Absalom even though David had told him not to do so. Then, Joab rebuked David for mourning for his rebellious son rather than rejoicing with his victorious troops. As Joab so memorably expressed it, “you love those who hate you and hate those who love you” ([19:6](https://www.esv.org/2+Samuel+19%3A6/)). Later, Joab supported Adonijah instead of Solomon as David’s successor. David advised Solomon to have Joab put to death. Joab was killed as he hid in the sanctuary. **([2 Samuel 19:1–8](https://www.esv.org/2+Samuel+19%3A1%E2%80%938/))**
