# Gideon Profile

## Gideon

**Gideon** was called by God to free the Israelites from oppression by the Midianites. After destroying an altar of Baal, he was given the name Jerubbaal, which means, “let Baal contend.” The name was a mocking challenge to this powerless false god. The God of Israel proved his own power by leading Gideon to choose his army in a very unusual way, reducing it from 32,000 to only 300 men. Those 300 men defeated the Midianites, not with the sword but with trumpets, torches, and pitchers! Gideon was viewed as a hero, and the people tried to make him king. He refused their request, rightly declaring that “the Lord will rule over you” ([8:23](https://www.esv.org/Judges+8%3A23/)). Sadly, however, Gideon went on to do things that suggested a heart filled with pride rather than humility. **([Judges 6:36–40](https://www.esv.org/Judges+6%3A36%E2%80%9340/))**
