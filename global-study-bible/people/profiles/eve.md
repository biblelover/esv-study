# Eve Profile

## Eve

God created **Eve**, whose name means “life,” as a helper for Adam. Fashioned from one of Adam’s ribs, Eve became the mother (that is, the female ancestor) of all human beings. Though enjoying perfect fellowship with God, Eve was deceived by the serpent and disobeyed God by eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Because of their sin, Adam and Eve were driven from the paradise of Eden and began to experience great hardship. For Eve, that included pain in childbearing. Yet, as promised in [Genesis 3:15](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+3%3A15/), one of her offspring would defeat the serpent and bring salvation and eternal life to all who put their trust in him. **([Genesis 2:23](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+2%3A23/))**
