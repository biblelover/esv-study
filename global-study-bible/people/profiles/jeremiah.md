# Jeremiah Profile

## Jeremiah

**Jeremiah** was born in Anathoth, a small town outside of Jerusalem. Called by God as a young man, he served as a prophet for more than 40 years. Jeremiah had a difficult life. By God’s command, he never married, and he apparently had only two converts during his entire ministry. The nation of Judah did not respond favorably to his messages of repentance. He was scorned in his own hometown and even falsely imprisoned on charges that he was collaborating with the Babylonian invaders. Like many of the Lord’s prophets, Jeremiah suffered public mockery and physical abuse. Yet God used his faithful servant to deliver the good news that in future days God would make a new, unbreakable covenant with his people ([31:31](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+31%3A31/)). [Hebrews 8:8–12](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+8%3A8%E2%80%9312/) quotes [Jeremiah 31:31–34](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+31%3A31%E2%80%9334/) as evidence that this new covenant has come through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. **([Jeremiah 31:31–34](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+31%3A31%E2%80%9334/))**
