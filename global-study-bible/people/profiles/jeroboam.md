## Jeroboam

**Jeroboam**, a servant of Solomon, was in charge of the forced labor doing construction work in Jerusalem. He was approached by the prophet Ahijah, who prophesied that he would one day be king over 10 of the tribes of Israel. This prophecy came true when, after Solomon’s death, his son Rehoboam refused to lighten his father’s heavy tax burden on the people. The 10 northern tribes revolted. They broke away from the two southern tribes and made Jeroboam their king. To prevent his people from returning to Jerusalem to worship, Jeroboam built competing centers of worship in Bethel and Dan. By inventing his own system of worship, he led the people of Israel astray. **([1 Kings 11:29–40](https://www.esv.org/1+Kings+11%3A29%E2%80%9340/))**
