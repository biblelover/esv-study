# Mary Profile

## Mary

As a young woman in Nazareth, **Mary** became betrothed to Joseph, a carpenter. The angel Gabriel visited Mary to announce that she had “found favor with God” ([1:30](https://www.esv.org/Luke+1%3A30/)) and would become the mother of the Messiah, whose name would be Jesus. While still a virgin, she would conceive through the power of the Holy Spirit. Though understandably confused by this news, Mary submitted to the Lord’s will for her life, saying, “Let it be to me according to your word” ([1:38](https://www.esv.org/Luke+1%3A38/)). As she observed the amazing events unfolding around her, Mary “treasured up all these things, pondering them in her heart” ([2:19](https://www.esv.org/Luke+2%3A19/); see also [2:51](https://www.esv.org/Luke+2%3A51/)). This included the warning that a “sword will pierce through your own soul also” ([2:35](https://www.esv.org/Luke+2%3A35/)), a prophecy fulfilled as, some 30 years later, she watched with sorrow as her son died on a cross. **([Luke 1:26–38](https://www.esv.org/Luke+1%3A26%E2%80%9338/))**
