## Josiah

**Josiah** was only eight years old when he became king of Judah. He had been ruling Judah for 18 years when Hilkiah, the high priest, found the Book of the Law. As soon as Josiah heard the commands of God, he tore his clothes in grief and despair. He launched a massive effort to abolish pagan worship throughout Judah and Israel. After organizing a covenant-renewal ceremony, he destroyed all the buildings associated with idol worship. Among his most significant deeds was restoring the celebration of the Passover, which had not been observed since the days of the judges. Josiah was more faithful to the Lord than even David and Hezekiah. He was like the ideal king described in [Deut. 17:19–20](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+17%3A19%E2%80%9320/). **([2 Kings 23:25](https://www.esv.org/2+Kings+23%3A25/))**
