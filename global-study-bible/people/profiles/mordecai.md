# Mordecai Profile

## Mordecai

**Mordecai** was a Jew living in exile in Persia. When Mordecai’s cousin [Esther](https://www.esv.org/Esther+1%3A1%E2%80%9310%3A3/) became an orphan he took her as his own child. Eventually Esther became queen, and Mordecai became a royal official. One day, while serving King Ahasuerus, Mordecai discovered and reported a plot to kill the king, thus saving the king’s life. Later, when Mordecai refused to bow down to Haman, who was second in command to the king, Haman persuaded the king to call for the death of all Jews. With the help of Queen Esther, Mordecai saved the Jews of Persia from this death sentence. Haman was hanged on the gallows he had prepared for Mordecai, and Mordecai replaced Haman as second in command to the king. **([Esther 9:4](https://www.esv.org/Esther+9%3A4/))**
