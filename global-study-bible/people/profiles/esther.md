# Esther Profile

## Esther

**Esther** was a Jew living among the exiles in Persia, during the reign of King Ahasuerus. Following the death of her parents, Esther was raised by her cousin, Mordecai. Esther was a beautiful woman, and she won favor in the eyes of all who saw her. When the reigning queen was removed from power, a beauty contest was held to choose her replacement, and Esther was chosen. As queen of Persia, Esther risked her life to save the Jewish people from annihilation. She and Mordecai instituted the Feast of Purim to commemorate their deliverance. **([Esther 4:14](https://www.esv.org/Esther+4%3A14/))**
