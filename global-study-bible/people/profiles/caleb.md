## Caleb

**Caleb** was one of 12 tribal leaders sent by Moses to spy out the land of Canaan. Of the 12 spies, only Caleb and Joshua brought back an encouraging report. The other spies emphasized the strength of Canaan’s inhabitants and concluded that Israel would face certain defeat. However, Caleb and Joshua urged the people not to rebel against the Lord’s promise to give the land to them or to fear Canaan’s inhabitants. They reminded the people that the Lord would protect them and keep his promise if they obeyed. When the congregation responded with anger, the Lord punished their disbelief. He promised that the entire generation would die in the wilderness, with the exception of Caleb and Joshua. When Caleb was 85 years old, he was given Hebron for an inheritance. **([Numbers 14:24](https://www.esv.org/Numbers+14%3A24/))**
