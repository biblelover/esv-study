# Uzziah Profile

## Uzziah

**Uzziah** was 16 years old when he became king, following the assassination of his father, Amaziah. Like many kings before him, Uzziah’s reign began with a period of faithfulness and blessing: “as long as he sought the Lord, God made him prosper” ([26:5](https://www.esv.org/2+Chronicles+26%3A5/)). But this was followed by a period of sin, leading to punishment from the Lord. Uzziah successfully battled the Philistines and demanded tribute from the Ammonites. His fame spread far and wide. Sadly, Uzziah’s success led to pride, and he began to desire spiritual as well as political authority over the people. Ignoring God’s law, he entered the temple to burn incense and was confronted by the priests. Rather than repent of his actions, Uzziah grew angry. The Lord immediately struck him with leprosy, forcing him to withdraw from his royal duties. **([2 Chronicles 26:3–5](https://www.esv.org/2+Chronicles+26%3A3%E2%80%935/))**
