## Noah

**Noah** was a righteous man who faithfully walked with God despite the wickedness of his generation. When God chose to destroy the earth because of its hopeless corruption, Noah alone found favor in his eyes. God instructed Noah to build an ark that would keep him and his family safe during the coming flood. Noah also took representative pairs of each kind of animal with him into the ark, to replenish the earth after the flood. God made a covenant with Noah, promising that he would never again destroy the earth with a flood. The NT calls Noah a “herald of righteousness” ([2 Pet. 2:5](https://www.esv.org/2+Peter+2%3A5/)). **([Genesis 6:7–8](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+6%3A7%E2%80%938/))**
