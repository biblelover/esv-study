# David Profile

## David

**David** was the youngest son of Jesse of Bethlehem. When Saul was rejected as king, God chose David as his successor. A handsome and gifted man, David played the lyre to soothe Saul, gaining his favor and eventually becoming his armor-bearer. On a mission to deliver food to his older brothers, David fought and killed the giant Goliath. He became Israel’s greatest king, and made Jerusalem the nation’s capital city. Although he was a godly man, David fell into sin with Bathsheba. God used him not because he was mighty or perfect, but because he found favor in God’s sight. The Lord promised David an eternal throne ([2 Sam. 7:16](https://www.esv.org/2+Samuel+7%3A16/)), and through his lineage came Jesus the Messiah. **([2 Samuel 7:1–29](https://www.esv.org/2+Samuel+7%3A1%E2%80%9329/))**
