## Philip

Along with Stephen, **Philip** was one of the seven men chosen to help the apostles minister to the early church. Referred to as “Philip the evangelist” ([21:8](https://www.esv.org/Acts+21%3A8/)), he began his ministry in Samaria, where he proclaimed Christ boldly and with power. Like the apostles, Philip had received the Holy Spirit’s power to cast out demons and to heal the sick. The Bible says that as a result of Philip’s ministry in Samaria “there was much joy in that city” ([8:8](https://www.esv.org/Acts+8%3A8/)). God later led Philip toward Gaza, where he explained the gospel to an Ethiopian royal official. After baptizing the man, Philip was immediately carried away by the Spirit of the Lord to a new area of ministry. **([Acts 8:5–8](https://www.esv.org/Acts+8%3A5%E2%80%938/))**
