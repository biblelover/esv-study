# Absalom Profile

## Absalom

David’s son **Absalom** was a handsome man with the personality of a strong leader. When Absalom’s half brother Amnon raped Absalom’s sister Tamar, Absalom retaliated by killing Amnon. He then fled into exile. Three years later he returned to Jerusalem and was reconciled with David. But then he led a rebellion against David, and David himself was forced to flee the city. While battling David’s men, Absalom’s long hair became stuck in the branches of an oak tree, enabling David’s commander Joab to kill him. Absalom’s death allowed David to return to Jerusalem, but he mourned bitterly for his fallen son. Absalom’s betrayal of his father helped fulfill Nathan’s prophecy ([12:10–12](https://www.esv.org/2+Samuel+12%3A10%E2%80%9312/)) that, because of his sin with Bathsheba, the “sword shall never depart” from David’s house. **([2 Samuel 15:1–6](https://www.esv.org/2+Samuel+15%3A1%E2%80%936/))**
