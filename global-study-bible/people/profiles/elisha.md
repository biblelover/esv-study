## Elisha

**Elisha** was Elijah’s disciple and assistant and, eventually, his successor. He served as a prophet for 55 years and became famous for the many miracles he performed. Among these miracles was the healing of Naaman, the commander of the Syrian army. Naaman was a leper and came to Israel seeking to be healed. Elisha told him to wash in the Jordan River seven times. At first, Naaman felt insulted by these simple instructions, but when he finally obeyed, he was healed instantly. Elisha’s God-given power did not end at his death. When a fallen soldier was thrown into Elisha’s grave, the soldier came back to life as soon as his body came into contact with the prophet’s bones ([13:20–21](https://www.esv.org/2+Kings+13%3A20%E2%80%9321/)). **([2 Kings 5:8–14](https://www.esv.org/2+Kings+5%3A8%E2%80%9314/))**
