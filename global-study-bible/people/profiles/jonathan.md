# Jonathan Profile

## Jonathan

**Jonathan** was King Saul’s oldest son. He showed great trust in God at Michmash ([14:6](https://www.esv.org/1+Samuel+14%3A6/)), where he led a daring raid that brought an Israelite victory over the Philistines. Jonathan became a close friend of David. The Bible says that he loved David “as his own soul” ([18:1](https://www.esv.org/1+Samuel+18%3A1/)). When his father sought to kill David, Jonathan warned his friend and helped him escape. As Saul’s popular eldest son, Jonathan would have been easily accepted as Saul’s heir. He showed radical self-denial, however, in giving up any right to the throne of Israel. He gave his absolute support to David as the Lord’s choice to succeed Saul as king. Jonathan remained devoted to his father, dying alongside him at Mount Gilboa. **([1 Samuel 18:1–4](https://www.esv.org/1+Samuel+18%3A1%E2%80%934/))**
