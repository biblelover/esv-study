## Bathsheba

**Bathsheba** was the beautiful wife of Uriah the Hittite, one of David’s warriors. While walking on his roof one afternoon, David saw Bathsheba bathing. He sent messengers to take her and bring her to him, and he committed adultery with her. Bathsheba became pregnant, and David desperately attempted to cover his sin. He first tried to make it appear that the child was Uriah’s, but when that failed, he plotted the murder of his faithful soldier. After Uriah’s death, David married Bathsheba. His sin brought evil upon his household, including the death of his and Bathsheba’s first child. God had mercy on David, who repented of his sin. Bathsheba bore him four sons, including Solomon. **([1 Kings 1:15–21](https://www.esv.org/1+Kings+1%3A15%E2%80%9321/))**
