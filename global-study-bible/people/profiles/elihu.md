## Elihu

**Elihu** rebuked both Job and his three friends. He was angry at Job for defending himself rather than God, and he was angry at Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar for failing to provide an answer for Job. During his lengthy speech, Elihu shifted the focus away from Job to God as the only source of certainty and hope. At the same time, he seemed to overestimate his own understanding, even claiming to speak “on God’s behalf” ([36:2](https://www.esv.org/Job+36%3A2/)). Actually, Elihu didn’t understand the reasons for Job’s suffering any more than the three friends did, and his statements were often similar to theirs. Although there was some truth in Elihu’s argument, his application of those truths and the conclusions he drew about Job were often incorrect. **([Job 32:1–5](https://www.esv.org/Job+32%3A1%E2%80%935/))**
