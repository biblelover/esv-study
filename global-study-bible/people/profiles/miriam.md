## Miriam

**Miriam** was the sister of Moses and Aaron. It was probably Miriam who saw Pharaoh’s daughter rescue Moses from the water, and offered to call a Hebrew woman to nurse the child. As a result, Moses was nursed by his own mother, who was paid wages to care for him. Miriam was a prophetess. Following the exodus she led the women of Israel in song and dance to celebrate God’s deliverance. Along with Aaron, she criticized Moses for marrying a Cushite woman, thus challenging his authority. God punished Miriam by inflicting her with leprosy, though she was healed after Moses prayed for her. [Micah 6:4](https://www.esv.org/Micah+6%3A4/) lists Miriam alongside her brothers as one whom God appointed to lead Israel. **([Exodus 15:20–21](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+15%3A20%E2%80%9321/))**
