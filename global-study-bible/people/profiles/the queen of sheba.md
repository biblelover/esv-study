## The Queen of Sheba

When word of Solomon’s extraordinary wisdom reached the ears of the **queen of Sheba**, she traveled from Arabia to Jerusalem to test him with hard questions. She came to Jerusalem with a remarkable entourage, including camels bearing spices and gold and precious stones. The queen was deeply impressed by Solomon’s wisdom and wealth. This Gentile queen recognized that Solomon’s greatness was from the true God of Israel, and that God himself had put Solomon on his throne. Although the queen gave Solomon a tremendous gift—about 9,000 pounds (4 kg) of gold—it paled in comparison to the riches that he presented to her. Solomon gave the queen all she desired and more, after which she returned to her own land. **([1 Kings 10:1–13](https://www.esv.org/1+Kings+10%3A1%E2%80%9313/))**
