# Zechariah Profile

## Zechariah

**Zechariah** was both a priest and a prophet. He was a member of a prominent family who returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel. Like Haggai, who ministered during the same time, Zechariah spoke about the need to rebuild the temple. He reassured Judah that if they would heed the words of the prophets and turn to the Lord, God would bless his people for their faithfulness. God would trouble the nations who were enjoying rest and grant rest to his troubled people, making Jerusalem once again the center of the world. Zechariah also prophesied about the coming of the Messiah. [Matthew](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+1%3A1%E2%80%9328%3A20/), [Mark](https://www.esv.org/Mark+1%3A1%E2%80%9316%3A20/), [John](https://www.esv.org/John+1%3A1%E2%80%9321%3A25/), [Ephesians](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+1%3A1%E2%80%936%3A24/), and [Revelation](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+1%3A1%E2%80%9322%3A21/) are among the NT books that quote Zechariah, recognizing Jesus as the fulfillment of his prophecies. **([Zechariah 8:1â€“8](https://www.esv.org/Zechariah+8%3A1%E2%80%938/))**
