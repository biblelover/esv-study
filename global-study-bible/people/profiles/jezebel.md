## Jezebel

**Jezebel** was the wife of King Ahab and the daughter of Ethbaal, king of Sidon. Because she was so wicked, her name, “Jezebel,” has become synonymous with evil ([Rev. 2:20](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+2%3A20/)). As queen of Israel, Jezebel acted with power and influenced King Ahab. She promoted the worship of Baal and ruthlessly killed many prophets of God. When she learned of the defeat of her false god on Mount Carmel ([1 Kings 18:20–40](https://www.esv.org/1+Kings+18%3A20%E2%80%9340/)), she tried to kill Elijah, forcing him to flee into the wilderness. When Ahab sulked because Naboth would not sell his vineyard to him, Jezebel arranged the murder of Naboth. Jezebel met a gruesome end when she was thrown from a window by her own servants and was eaten by dogs, in fulfillment of Elijah’s prophecy ([2 Kings 9:30–37](https://www.esv.org/2+Kings+9%3A30%E2%80%9337/)). **([2 Kings 9:36–37](https://www.esv.org/2+Kings+9%3A36%E2%80%9337/))**
