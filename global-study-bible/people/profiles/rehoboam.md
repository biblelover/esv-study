## Rehoboam

Following the death of King Solomon, the people of Israel gathered at Shechem to make Solomon’s son, **Rehoboam**, their king. The people made one request: that Rehoboam lighten the heavy tax burden that his father had forced upon them. Rather than honor their request, however, Rehoboam vowed to make life even harder for the people of Israel. Disregarding the wise advice of his older counselors, Rehoboam followed the younger men’s counsel and warned the people: “My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions” ([10:14](https://www.esv.org/2+Chronicles+10%3A14/)). His plan for more oppressive control backfired, however, when the 10 northern tribes revolted and set up Jeroboam as their king. The northern kingdom would now be known as Israel and the southern kingdom would be called Judah. **([2 Chronicles 12:13–14](https://www.esv.org/2+Chronicles+12%3A13%E2%80%9314/))**
