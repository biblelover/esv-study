## Ezekiel

**Ezekiel** ministered during the same troubled times as the prophet Jeremiah. He was among the thousands of Judeans exiled to Babylon, where he probably spent the remainder of his life. About five years into the exile, at the age of 30, Ezekiel was called as a prophet. God commanded him to speak the word of God fearlessly to the people, regardless of whether or not they listened. He was appointed as a “watchman” for Israel ([3:17; 33:1–9](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+3%3A17%2C+33%3A1%E2%80%939/)), whose task it was to warn the people that God would punish them unless they repented. Courageous sermons, dramatic visions, and symbolic actions characterized Ezekiel’s ministry. God asked Ezekiel to enact difficult messages, often at a great personal cost. When his wife died, Ezekiel was commanded not to mourn for her, as a sign to Israel ([24:15–27](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+24%3A15%E2%80%9327/)). Like Jeremiah, Ezekiel remained a faithful, humble servant despite his difficult life as a prophet. **([Ezekiel 33:1–9](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+33%3A1%E2%80%939/))**
