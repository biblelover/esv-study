## Aquila and his wife, Priscilla

**Aquila and his wife, Priscilla** (also called Prisca), were close friends and coworkers with the apostle Paul. Forced from Rome by the emperor Claudius, they fled to Corinth ([18:1–2](https://www.esv.org/Acts+18%3A1%E2%80%932/)). Like Paul, who stayed in their home, they were tentmakers by trade. On his way back to Antioch, Paul left Priscilla and Aquila in Ephesus to establish the church in that city. There the godly couple taught the Christian way “more accurately” to a gifted Alexandrian disciple named Apollos ([18:26](https://www.esv.org/Acts+18%3A26/)). They were eventually able to return to Rome, where the church met in their home ([Rom. 16:3–5](https://www.esv.org/Romans+16%3A3%E2%80%935/)). Paul’s deep love and respect for Aquila and Priscilla is obvious in his letter to the Romans, where he declares that the couple “risked their necks” for his life ([Rom. 16:3](https://www.esv.org/Romans+16%3A3/)). **([Romans 16:3–5](https://www.esv.org/Romans+16%3A3%E2%80%935/))**
