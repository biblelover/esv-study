# Luke Profile

## Luke

**Luke** was a doctor ([Col. 4:14](https://www.esv.org/Colossians+4%3A14/)) and a faithful companion of Paul, accompanying him on several journeys. He was with Paul throughout his two-year imprisonments in both Caesarea and Rome. He is the author of the Gospel bearing his name and the book of [Acts](https://www.esv.org/Acts+1%3A1%E2%80%9328%3A31/), where he records his travels with Paul. Little else is known about Luke. Most scholars believe that he was a Gentile. This is based in part on the fact that Paul does not include Luke among the “men of the circumcision” who were his fellow workers ([Col. 4:10–11](https://www.esv.org/Colossians+4%3A10%E2%80%9311/)). How Luke came to know Christ is not revealed, though his thorough acquaintance with the OT suggests that he may have been a “God-fearer” like Cornelius before becoming a Christian. **([Acts 21:1–8](https://www.esv.org/Acts+21%3A1%E2%80%938/))**
