## Herod Agrippa II

**Herod Agrippa II** was the son of Herod Agrippa I and the great-grandson of Herod the Great. Following the death of his father, Agrippa II ruled over several minor territories. He had authority over the temple in Jerusalem, including the right to appoint the high priest. Festus, a Roman unfamiliar with the Jewish faith, sought Agrippa’s advice regarding Paul’s case (chs. [25–26](https://www.esv.org/Acts+25%3A1%E2%80%9326%3A32/)). While defending himself before Agrippa, Paul presented a detailed explanation of the gospel. Though Agrippa resisted Paul’s appeal to believe in Christ, he listened sympathetically to his defense ([26:28](https://www.esv.org/Acts+26%3A28/)). He said that if Paul had not appealed to Caesar, he could have been released. **([Acts 26:27–32](https://www.esv.org/Acts+26%3A27%E2%80%9332/))**
