## Mary, Sister of Lazarus

**Mary**, along with her sister Martha and her brother Lazarus, was a close friend of Jesus. Mary was intensely devoted to Jesus, choosing to sit at his feet and listen to his teaching while Martha struggled to be a good hostess (see [Luke 10:38-42](https://www.esv.org/Luke+10%3A38%E2%80%9342/)). Martha was annoyed that Mary didn’t help her, but Jesus praised Mary’s decision, saying that it demonstrated her desire for close fellowship with the Lord. On another occasion Mary was scolded by the disciples, who were indignant that she anointed Jesus with costly ointment rather than selling it and giving the money to the poor. Again, Jesus defended Mary’s actions of humility and devotion. **([John 12:3](https://www.esv.org/John+12%3A3/))**
