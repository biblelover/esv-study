# Rachel Profile

## Rachel

**Rachel** was the daughter of Laban, uncle of Jacob. She became Jacob’s wife. Since she was a shep­herdess, it is fitting that Rachel’s name means “ewe.” Rachel was a beautiful woman, and the Bible says that Jacob loved her immediately. So deep was his love for her that after being deceived into marrying her older sister Leah, Jacob promised to work an additional seven years for Laban so that he could marry Rachel as well. There was constant strife between the sisters because Jacob favored Rachel, and because Rachel was envious of Leah’s ability to have children. After many years of waiting, however, Rachel gave birth to Joseph and Benjamin. [Ruth 4:11](https://www.esv.org/Ruth+4%3A11/) says that Rachel and Leah “together built up the house of Israel.” **([Genesis 29:18, 20](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+29%3A18%2C+29%3A20/))**
