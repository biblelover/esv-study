# Samuel Profile

## Samuel

Samuel’s birth was God’s answer to Hannah’s prayer for a son. Dedicated to the Lord as a small child, he lived and ministered at Shiloh. When he was a young man, the Lord spoke to him and established him as a prophet. **Samuel** called the people of Israel to repent and put aside idolatry. During Samuel’s lifetime, Israel changed from a collection of tribes ruled by various temporary “judges” to a nation ruled by a king. As the last judge of Israel, Samuel anointed Saul as Israel’s first king. When Saul disobeyed God and was rejected as king, Samuel anointed David as his successor. Samuel acted as a faithful judge, prophet, and priest, foreshadowing the work of Christ as king, prophet, and priest ([Heb. 1:1–3](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+1%3A1%E2%80%933/)). **([1 Samuel 3:19–21](https://www.esv.org/1+Samuel+3%3A19%E2%80%9321/))**
