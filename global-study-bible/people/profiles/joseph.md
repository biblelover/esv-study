# Joseph Profile

## Joseph

**Joseph** was the son of Jacob and his favored wife Rachel. Jacob therefore showed favoritism toward Joseph, which made his brothers despise him. Out of jealousy, they sold him into slavery. Joseph was taken to Egypt, where he was purchased by a royal official. Joseph was imprisoned on false charges but was released after interpreting the dreams of Pharaoh. Because the dreams had predicted seven years of famine, Pharaoh put Joseph in charge of preparing for the famine. During the famine Joseph’s family unknowingly came to him for help, and Joseph forgave his brothers and rescued his family. Through Joseph, God used evil to work out his good purposes, foreshadowing the time when he would bring the supreme good of eternal salvation out of the wicked actions of those who crucified Jesus. **([Genesis 50:19–20](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+50%3A19%E2%80%9320/))**


## Joseph

**Joseph**, whom the Bible describes as a “just man” ([Matt. 1:19](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+1%3A19/)), was a descendant of David and a carpenter by trade. Betrothed to Mary when she was found to be with child, Joseph sought to show compassion and divorce her quietly, even though it looked like Mary had committed adultery. An angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, however, assuring him that Mary’s child was from the Holy Spirit ([Matt. 1:20–21](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+1%3A20%E2%80%9321/)). Joseph trusted God and took Mary as his wife. He traveled with Mary to his ancestral home of Bethlehem, where she gave birth to Jesus. When Herod the Great sought to kill Jesus, Joseph took Mary and the child and escaped to Egypt ([Matt. 2:13–18](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+2%3A13%E2%80%9318/)). Following Herod’s death, they returned to Palestine and settled in Nazareth. Joseph later fathered at least four other sons and at least two daughters. Since he is not mentioned in the incident related in [Matt. 12:46](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+12%3A46/), it is likely that Joseph died before Jesus began his ministry. **([Matthew 1:19–21](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+1%3A19%E2%80%9321/))**
