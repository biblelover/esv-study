## Malachi

**Malachi**, whose name means “my messenger,” probably ministered during the same time as Ezra and Nehemiah. He prophesied to Judah about 80 years after Haggai and Zechariah had encouraged the people to rebuild the temple. Though Haggai and Zechariah had assured Judah that God’s blessings would return to his people, bringing peace and prosperity, they had not yet experienced these promised blessings. Instead, they were facing a prolonged period of economic difficulty and hardship. Rather than wait faithfully on the Lord, the people sinned against him with half-hearted worship and imperfect offerings. God used Malachi to reaffirm his love for Israel and to rebuke them for their unfaithfulness to him. Malachi urged Judah to remember the Law of Moses, as well as the promise of Elijah and the coming day of the Lord. **([Malachi 4:1–6](https://www.esv.org/Malachi+4%3A1%E2%80%936/))**
