# Mary Magdalene Profile

## Mary Magdalene

Mary was called Magdalene because she was from Magdala, on the western shore of Galilee. She ex­­perienced incredible healing when Jesus drove seven demons from her ([Luke 8:2](https://www.esv.org/Luke+8%3A2/)). **Mary Magdalene** became a faithful and courageous disciple of Jesus. After witnessing the crucifixion, she visited Jesus’ tomb to complete burial preparations—only to find the tomb empty. She became the first person to witness the resurrected Jesus when he appeared to her as she stood outside the tomb weeping. Distraught, she first supposed Jesus to be the gardener. But all Jesus had to do was say her name and Mary Magdalene recognized her beloved Lord. It was she who ran to tell the disciples of Jesus’ resurrection. **([John 20:1–18](https://www.esv.org/John+20%3A1%E2%80%9318/))**
