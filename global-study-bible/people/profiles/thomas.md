## Thomas

**Thomas**, one of the 12 disciples, was called “the Twin.” He courageously declared that he was willing to die with Jesus ([11:16](https://www.esv.org/John+11%3A16/)). Unfortunately, however, he is most remembered for displaying doubt rather than bravery. When Jesus first appeared to the disciples following his resurrection, Thomas was not with them. Overcome with uncertainty, he refused to believe the news that Jesus was alive. Thomas declared that he would believe only if he were able to see the scars from Jesus’ crucifixion on his hands and side. A few days later, Thomas was with the other disciples when Jesus appeared to them again. When Jesus invited him to see and touch his wounds, Thomas immediately responded, “My Lord and my God!” ([20:28](https://www.esv.org/John+20%3A28/)). **([John 20:24–28](https://www.esv.org/John+20%3A24%E2%80%9328/))**
