## Jehoshaphat

Like his father, Asa, King **Jehoshaphat** was faithful to the Lord and received God’s blessings. He strengthened his kingdom both spiritually and militarily, and appointed teachers to go throughout Judah and teach the people concerning the Book of the Law. Large armies served Jehoshaphat, and he built up fortresses and store cities in Judah. He had great riches and honor. Jehoshaphat is criticized, however, for his association with the ungodly northern kingdom, including a marriage alliance with King Ahab. Such alliances caused the king to “help the wicked and love those who hate the Lord” ([19:2](https://www.esv.org/2+Chronicles+19%3A2/)). Despite his shortcomings, Jehoshaphat is remembered primarily for his great faith and leadership and as one who did “what was right in the sight of the Lord” ([20:32](https://www.esv.org/2+Chronicles+20%3A32/)). **([2 Chronicles 19:4](https://www.esv.org/2+Chronicles+19%3A4/))**
