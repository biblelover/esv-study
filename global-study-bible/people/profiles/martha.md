# Martha Profile

## Martha

**Martha** was the sister of Mary and Lazarus. The three of them were close friends of Jesus. Martha welcomed Jesus into her home in Bethany, where she prepared him meals as he taught. A conscientious hostess, Martha busied herself with serving her guests while Mary chose instead to listen to Jesus’ teaching. This frustrated Martha, but Jesus gently rebuked her and defended Mary’s desire to learn from him ([10:38–42](https://www.esv.org/Luke+10%3A38%E2%80%9342/)). It was Martha and Mary who sent word to Jesus when their brother Lazarus became ill ([John 11](https://www.esv.org/John+11%3A1%E2%80%9357/)). Even though Lazarus had died by the time Jesus arrived at their home, Martha believed that God could work a miracle through Jesus. When Jesus gave Martha an opportunity to express her faith, she replied, “Yes, Lord; I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming into the world” ([John 11:27](https://www.esv.org/John+11%3A27/)). **([Luke 10:38–42](https://www.esv.org/Luke+10%3A38%E2%80%9342/))**
