# Ruth Profile

## Ruth

Naomi, along with her husband and two sons, moved from Israel to Moab to seek relief from a famine. In Moab, one of her sons married **Ruth**, a Moabite. When Naomi’s husband and sons died, she decided to return to her home in Bethlehem. Naomi urged Ruth to stay behind in her native land, but out of love for her mother-in-law, Ruth chose to return with her to Bethlehem and to serve the Lord. Following her mother-in-law’s daring plan, Ruth took courageous steps to provide a new family for herself and Naomi. She married Boaz, and they had a son, Obed, who became the grandfather of King David. This means that Ruth was included in the lineage of Jesus Christ. Ruth’s expression of love for her mother-in-law ([1:16–17](https://www.esv.org/Ruth+1%3A16%E2%80%9317/)) has set a high standard for godly relationships down through the ages. **([Ruth 1:16–17](https://www.esv.org/Ruth+1%3A16%E2%80%9317/))**
