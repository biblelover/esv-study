# Daniel Facts

## #1: What’s in a name?
**What’s in a name?** Changing a person’s name ([1:7](https://www.esv.org/Daniel+1%3A7/)) was a sign of having power over that person. Conquering rulers often did this to their captives as a means of making them more a part of their new culture.


## #2: The dreams of a king
**The dreams of a king** ([2:1](https://www.esv.org/Daniel+2%3A1/)) had significance for his nation as a whole because dreams were thought to be the shadows of future events. If the dreams of a king could be correctly interpreted, then the appropriate actions could be taken to preserve the kingdom.


## #3: Daniel’s languages
**Daniel’s languages.** The book of [Daniel](https://www.esv.org/Daniel+1%3A1%E2%80%9312%3A13/) was written in both Hebrew ([1:1–2:3; 7:1–12:13](https://www.esv.org/Daniel+1%3A1%E2%80%932%3A3%2C+7%3A1%E2%80%9312%3A13/)) and Aramaic ([2:4–7:28](https://www.esv.org/Daniel+2%3A4%E2%80%937%3A28/)). In OT times, Aramaic was the language used by several people groups in the Middle East (see [2 Kings 18:26](https://www.esv.org/2+Kings+18%3A26/)).


## #4: Tree
A **tree** represents King Nebuchadnezzar in his dream ([4:5–27](https://www.esv.org/Daniel+4%3A5%E2%80%9327/)). Trees can symbolize great kingdoms in the Bible. [Ezekiel 31:2–9](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+31%3A2%E2%80%939/) compares Assyria to a cedar that shelters the nations. Jesus uses a tree to describe God’s kingdom ([Mark 4:32](https://www.esv.org/Mark+4%3A32/)).


## #5: The city of Babylon
**The city of Babylon** had some of the most impressive buildings of the ancient Near East. It was home to the famous Hanging Gardens, which was one of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world. Its outer walls were wide enough for chariots driven by four horses to pass each other.


## #6: Lions’ dens
**Lions’ dens** ([6:17](https://www.esv.org/Daniel+6%3A17/)) were built to house captured lions, which would be later released and hunted for sport. Ancient writings other than the Bible also include stories of people being placed in cages with predatory animals.


## #7: Opening the books
**Opening the books.** Scribes recorded the daily events and activities of royal courts. These writings served as records for the archives and also could provide testimony for court hearings. Daniel’s first readers would have understood quite well his vision of God opening the books ([7:10](https://www.esv.org/Daniel+7%3A10/)).


## #8: Gabriel
**Gabriel** is the first angel mentioned by name in the Bible ([8:16; 9:21](https://www.esv.org/Daniel+8%3A16%2C+9%3A21/)). Michael, the only other angel named in Scripture, also appears in [Daniel](https://www.esv.org/Daniel+1%3A1%E2%80%9312%3A13/) ([10:13, 21; 12:1](https://www.esv.org/Daniel+10%3A13%2C+10%3A21%2C+12%3A1/)). In the NT, Gabriel was the angel who announced the births of John the Baptist and Jesus ([Luke 1:19, 26](https://www.esv.org/Luke+1%3A19%2C+1%3A26/)). Michael appears again in [Rev. 12:7](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+12%3A7/).


## #9: Daniel’s prayer
**Daniel’s prayer.** Jeremiah prophesied that God would restore his people after 70 years in Babylon ([Jer. 25:11–14; 29:10](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+25%3A11%E2%80%9314%2C+29%3A10/)). With this in mind, Daniel prays for Israel’s restoration ([Dan. 9:1–19](https://www.esv.org/Daniel+9%3A1%E2%80%9319/)).


## #10: Mighty king
The **mighty king** mentioned in [11:3](https://www.esv.org/Daniel+11%3A3/) is Alexander the Great, who reigned from 336 to 323 b.c. Alexander created one of the largest empires in ancient history, stretching from Greece to India. He brought the Greek language and culture to the Middle East, which is why the NT was originally written in Greek.


## #11: Antiochus IV Epiphanes
The reign of **Antiochus IV Epiphanes** (175–164 b.c.) was disastrous for the Jews ([11:21–35](https://www.esv.org/Daniel+11%3A21%E2%80%9335/); see [8:9–14, 23–25](https://www.esv.org/Daniel+8%3A9%E2%80%9314%2C+8%3A23%E2%80%9325/)). He banned circumcision, ended the sacrifices, and defiled the temple. Judas Maccabeus led a revolt against him in 167 b.c.


## #12: Purity
**Purity.** In [12:10](https://www.esv.org/Daniel+12%3A10/), “white” symbolizes purity, as in clothing that is clean rather than dirty (see [7:9](https://www.esv.org/Daniel+7%3A9/)). “Refined” means purified or cleansed. Revelation similarly pictures saints wearing white clothes ([Rev. 4:4; 7:13–14; 19:8](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+4%3A4%2C+7%3A13%E2%80%9314%2C+19%3A8/)).
