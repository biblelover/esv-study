# Deuteronomy Facts

## #1: The Arabah
**The Arabah** ([1:7](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+1%3A7/)) refers to the rugged and extremely dry region surrounding and south of the Dead Sea. The Israelites’ travels took them through this area.


## #2: Was Deuteronomy a treaty?
**Was [Deuteronomy](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+1%3A1%E2%80%9334%3A12/) a treaty?** There are many similarities between the book of [Deuteronomy](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+1%3A1%E2%80%9334%3A12/) and various ancient Near Eastern treaties that date from the time of Moses. When a nation made a treaty with a less powerful nation, the document began with the past relationship between the countries. Next, the treaty stated the laws that would govern the relationship from that point on. Finally, the treaty concluded with a list of blessings and punishments for obedience or disobedience.


## #3: Gilead
Nations fought for control of **Gilead** ([2:36](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+2%3A36/)) because an international trade route, known as the King’s Highway, passed through it. The region was also an important area for agriculture. It was especially famous for the “balm of Gilead,” a resin used as medicine ([Jer. 8:22](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+8%3A22/)).


## #4: The Jordan River
**The Jordan River** begins in the foothills of Mount Hermon and empties into the Dead Sea. The Jordan is more than 200 miles (322 km) long—the longest river in Palestine.


## #5: A book of sermons?
**A book of sermons?** [Deuteronomy](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+1%3A1%E2%80%9334%3A12/) consists of at least three addresses or sermons from Moses to Israel. Moses encourages Israel to obey all the commandments of God.


## #6: Shema
[Deuteronomy 6:4](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+6%3A4/) is called the ****Shema****, from the Hebrew word for “hear.” Today many people of the Jewish faith fulfill the commands of [6:8–9](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+6%3A8%E2%80%939/) literally: They write Bible verses on pieces of paper, place them in small boxes, and then they either tie the boxes to their arm or their forehead, or attach them to the doorposts of their home.


## #7: Jesus quoted from
**Jesus quoted from** the book of [Deuteronomy](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+1%3A1%E2%80%9334%3A12/) more than any other OT book. He quoted [8:3](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+8%3A3/) when tempted by Satan ([Matt. 4:4](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+4%3A4/)).


## #8: Sojourner
A **sojourner** was a person from another country who was living and working in Israel. The Israelites were taught to love and respect the sojourners living among them, for they themselves had been sojourners in Egypt ([10:19](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+10%3A19/)).


## #9: Live long in the land of Israel
God promised his people that they would **live long in the land** of Israel, if they would love, obey, and serve him ([11:9, 21](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+11%3A9%2C+11%3A21/)). They failed to do this and were eventually defeated and taken into exile ([2 Kings 17; 25](https://www.esv.org/2+Kings+17%3A1%E2%80%9341%2C+25%3A1%E2%80%9330/)).


## #10: Death penalty for apostasy?
**Death penalty for apostasy?** Anyone who urged a fellow Israelite to “go and serve other gods” was to be put to death ([13:6–11](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+13%3A6%E2%80%9311/)). While the NT does not prescribe death for such an offense, it gives serious warning to anyone who leads another person into sin ([Matt. 18:6](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+18%3A6/)).


## #11: What is unleavened bread?
**What is unleavened bread?** Leaven is another name for yeast. Because bread made without yeast does not rise, unleavened bread is flat. During the exodus, the Israelites left Egypt so quickly that there was no time for their bread to rise. Unleavened bread was therefore used in Passover celebrations. 


## #12: Threshing
**Threshing** is the process of separating kernels of grain (such as barley and wheat) from their stalks. This was done by beating the stalks or by using an ox or a donkey to pull a weighted sled over the harvest. Often large, flat rocks were used as threshing floors ([16:13](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+16%3A13/)).


## #13: Sheep
**Sheep** are mentioned more than any other animal in the Bible. Sheep are dependent on shepherds to protect and care for them.


## #14: Inheritance rights
**Inheritance rights.** In Israel, the firstborn son received a double share of the inheritance. The firstborn also had more responsibility for the family than other children. The law protected the special rights of the firstborn ([21:15–17](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+21%3A15%E2%80%9317/)).


## #15: Why did the Israelites sew tassels on their garments?
**Why did the Israelites sew tassels on their garments?** In the ancient world, tassels were worn by nobles and other high-class people. In Israel they were worn by **everyone** as a mark of their special status and responsibilities as God’s chosen people ([22:12](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+22%3A12/); [Num. 15:37–41](https://www.esv.org/Numbers+15%3A37%E2%80%9341/)).


## #16: What was an upper millstone?
**What was an upper millstone?** Israelite women ground their grain in mills made of two circular stones. The grain was placed on the flat lower stone and then crushed as the upper millstone rolled over it. To deprive the miller of either stone would make her work impossible ([24:6](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+24%3A6/)).


## #17: Shoes and sandals
**Shoes and sandals** were considered the most humble articles of clothing. They were removed at the doorway before entering a home. People also removed their shoes during periods of mourning. Going barefoot was a sign of poverty and shame ([25:9–10](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+25%3A9%E2%80%9310/)).


## #18: Mount Ebal
At more than 3,000 feet (914 m) high, **Mount Ebal** is one of the highest points in Samaria.


## #19: Brimstone
**Brimstone** most likely refers to sulfur. It is a bright yellow, highly combustible mineral that puts out a terrible odor when it burns. Brimstone is abundant in the area around the Dead Sea. During earthquakes hot gases are released from inside the earth, which can cause the brimstone deposits to burst into flame ([29:23](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+29%3A23/)).


## #20: Walk this way!
**Walk this way!** The Bible often describes godly living as “walking” with the Lord ([30:16](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+30%3A16/); [Ps. 23:4](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+23%3A4/); [Eph. 4:1](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+4%3A1/)).


## #21: Demons
Idols represent gods that don’t actually exist, but the **demons** behind idol worship are real ([32:17](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+32%3A17/)).


## #22: Genesis through Deuteronomy
**[Genesis](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+1%3A1%E2%80%9350%3A26/) through [Deuteronomy](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+1%3A1%E2%80%9334%3A12/)** are the foundation of the Bible. They introduce the key promises that show God’s purposes in history and prepare for the coming of Jesus Christ.
