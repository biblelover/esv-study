# Job Facts

## #1: Comfort
**Comfort** is a key word in the book of [Job](https://www.esv.org/Job+1%3A1%E2%80%9342%3A17/). When faced with personal tragedies, Job receives no comfort from his friends ([16:2](https://www.esv.org/Job+16%3A2/)). But when God answers him (see chs. [38–41](https://www.esv.org/Job+38%3A1%E2%80%9341%3A34/)), he finds the comfort he needs.


## #2: Seven days and seven nights
**Seven days and seven nights** was a traditional period for mourning in the ancient Near East ([2:13](https://www.esv.org/Job+2%3A13/)).


## #3: Was Job a real person?
**Was Job a real person?** It is not known exactly when Job lived, but he was a real person. [Ezekiel 14:14, 20](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+14%3A14%2C+14%3A20/) and [James 5:11](https://www.esv.org/James+5%3A11/) refer to him as a historical figure.


## #4: What is Sheol
**What is Sheol**? In the OT, Sheol ([7:9–10](https://www.esv.org/Job+7%3A9%E2%80%9310/)) is where the dead reside. It is a place of rest for believers ([1 Sam. 28:14](https://www.esv.org/1+Samuel+28%3A14/)), but a place of punishment for the wicked ([Isa. 14:3–23](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+14%3A3%E2%80%9323/)).


## #5: The sea
In the literature of the ancient Near East, **the sea** ([9:8](https://www.esv.org/Job+9%3A8/)) is often seen as a threat to the order of nature. People looked upon the sea as something that could not be contained or conquered.


## #6: Clay
**Clay** was one of the most readily available materials in ancient times. It was used to construct buildings and to make everyday household items. Job describes himself as having been made “like clay” ([10:9](https://www.esv.org/Job+10%3A9/)) and says that he will someday return to dust. This should remind readers of [Genesis 2:7](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+2%3A7/), where the Lord created man from dust.


## #7: Three cycles of conversations
The book of [Job](https://www.esv.org/Job+1%3A1%E2%80%9342%3A17/) includes **three cycles of conversations** in which the friends of Job offer their comfort and advice, and then listen as Job responds. The first cycle covers chs. [4–14](https://www.esv.org/Job+4%3A1%E2%80%9314%3A22/).


## #8: Sackcloth
**Sackcloth** ([16:15](https://www.esv.org/Job+16%3A15/)) was an outward sign of grieving. It was a coarse fabric used for grain sacks. It was very uncomfortable to wear and thus showed that the person was truly grieving. It was also worn to show repentance.


## #9: Proverbs in Job
**[Proverbs](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+1%3A1%E2%80%9331%3A31/) in Job.** In [17:5](https://www.esv.org/Job+17%3A5/), Job may have been quoting a proverb to warn his friends not to make false accusations against him. [Proverbs](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+1%3A1%E2%80%9331%3A31/) are an effective and memorable way of stating a truth. The book of [Proverbs](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+1%3A1%E2%80%9331%3A31/) is a rich resource of such wisdom.


## #10: Honey
**Honey** is mentioned often in the Bible (see [20:17](https://www.esv.org/Job+20%3A17/)). People probably gathered the honey from wild bees. The gathering of wild honey led to an interesting episode in the life of Samson ([Judg. 14:8–20](https://www.esv.org/Judges+14%3A8%E2%80%9320/)).


## #11: Pledge
A **pledge** ([22:6](https://www.esv.org/Job+22%3A6/)) was an object of worth given as a down payment on a debt. Israelites were not to take in pledge essential items such as clothing ([Ex. 22:26](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+22%3A26/)) or tools a person needed for their work ([Deut. 24:6](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+24%3A6/)).


## #12: Those who rebel against the light
**Those who rebel against the light** is how Job describes people who oppose wisdom and righteousness ([24:13](https://www.esv.org/Job+24%3A13/)). They sleep during the day and do their evil deeds at night.


## #13: Hanging on nothing?
**Hanging on nothing?** Although he didn’t have all the tools of modern science, Job understood that God “hangs the earth on nothing” ([26:7](https://www.esv.org/Job+26%3A7/)). His infinite power keeps every planet, moon, and star in its appointed place ([Col. 1:15–17](https://www.esv.org/Colossians+1%3A15%E2%80%9317/)).


## #14: Rocks pouring out streams of oil
**Rocks pouring out streams of oil** ([29:6](https://www.esv.org/Job+29%3A6/)) is a reference to olive trees. They are one of the few trees that thrive in rocky soil. It can be 10 years or more before an olive tree yields fruit, but then it can produce olives for hundreds of years. Some olive trees are more than a thousand years old.


## #15: Elihu
**Elihu** is the only character in the book of [Job](https://www.esv.org/Job+1%3A1%E2%80%9342%3A17/) with a Hebrew name.


## #16: Pits
**Pits** were used for everything from water collection and food storage to animal traps and prisons. Pits were often seen as signs of danger, representing the final destination of the wicked ([33:18](https://www.esv.org/Job+33%3A18/)). Often the wicked are described as falling into the very pits that they themselves dug ([Ps. 7:15](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+7%3A15/); [Prov. 26:27](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+26%3A27/)).


## #17: Songs in the night
**Songs in the night.** Without the conveniences of modern streetlights or flashlights, nights in the ancient world were very dark and often frightening. People could easily hurt themselves at night or fall prey to animals or criminals. Songs of worship were a great comfort in those circumstances ([35:10](https://www.esv.org/Job+35%3A10/)).


## #18: Snow from Mount Hermon
The **snow from Mount Hermon** is an important water source for the Jordan River, but the climate in much of Israel is too mild for regular snowfall. In Job, snow is a symbol of purity ([37:6](https://www.esv.org/Job+37%3A6/)).


## #19: Majesty
God’s great **majesty** shines forth in poetic language in chs. [38–39](https://www.esv.org/Job+38%3A1%E2%80%9339%3A30/). These are some of the Bible’s most awe-inspiring passages about God.


## #20: Behemoth
**Behemoth** can refer to cattle. In [40:15](https://www.esv.org/Job+40%3A15/) it is probably a hippopotamus.
