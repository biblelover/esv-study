# Jonah Facts

## #1: Tarshish
**Tarshish** was probably a city on the western shores of the Mediterranean Sea, which would have represented the very western edge of the known world in Jonah’s time. Jonah foolishly thought this far-off land would take him “away from the presence of the Lord” ([1:3](https://www.esv.org/Jonah+1%3A3/)).


## #2: Nineveh
**Nineveh** was located along the Tigris River, across from what is now the city of Mosul in northern Iraq. Its location at the intersection of important trade routes made it strong and wealthy.


## #3: Population of Nineveh
The **population of Nineveh** after the time of Sennacherib’s reign (704–681 b.c.) was close to 300,000, over twice as many people as in Jonah’s time. This huge population increase was due primarily to Sennacherib making Nineveh the capital of the Assyrian Empire. He created new streets and open spaces for trade and built his famous “palace without rival.” These attractions would have drawn thousands of people to live in Nineveh.
