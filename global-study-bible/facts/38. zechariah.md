# Zechariah Facts

## #1: Zechariah in the NT
**Zechariah in the NT.** Several NT writers quote or allude to the book of [Zechariah](https://www.esv.org/Zechariah+1%3A1%E2%80%9314%3A21/). One estimate is that 54 passages from Zechariah occur in 67 different places in the NT. Many of these are in [Revelation](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+1%3A1%E2%80%9322%3A21/).


## #2: The number four
**The number four** in Scripture is often associated with creation or completeness. There are four different directions of the compass, four elements, four seasons of the year, and four times of day (morning, noon, evening, and midnight). In [1:18](https://www.esv.org/Zechariah+1%3A18/), four represents all of the world powers responsible for the scattering of Judah. However, the Lord, who is sovereign over his creation, will care for his people and punish their oppressors.


## #3: Eight visions
**Eight visions.** The book of [Zechariah](https://www.esv.org/Zechariah+1%3A1%E2%80%9314%3A21/) has two major sections: chs. [1–8](https://www.esv.org/Zechariah+1%3A1%E2%80%938%3A23/) and chs. [9–14](https://www.esv.org/Zechariah+9%3A1%E2%80%9314%3A21/). The first section contains eight visions that describe what God plans to do. Many of the symbols and images in these visions also appear in [Revelation](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+1%3A1%E2%80%9322%3A21/).


## #4: Widows, fatherless children, sojourners, and the poor
**Widows, fatherless children, sojourners, and the poor** were vulnerable members of society ([7:10](https://www.esv.org/Zechariah+7%3A10/)). Treating them justly and kindly matters very much to the Lord, and he will punish those who mistreat them (see [Ex. 22:21–24](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+22%3A21%E2%80%9324/); [Deut. 10:18–19](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+10%3A18%E2%80%9319/)).


## #5: “Your king is coming.”
**“Your king is coming.”** In [9:9](https://www.esv.org/Zechariah+9%3A9/), Zechariah prophesies about the coming of a future king of Israel. The NT quotes this verse when describing Jesus’ triumphal entry into Jerusalem, riding on a donkey ([Matt. 21:5](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+21%3A5/); [John 12:15](https://www.esv.org/John+12%3A15/)).


## #6: When did Israel defeat Greece?
**When did Israel defeat Greece?** Zechariah predicted that the sons of Zion would someday defeat the sons of Greece ([9:13](https://www.esv.org/Zechariah+9%3A13/)). This is probably a prophecy of the Maccabean revolt in the second century b.c., when the Jews defeated the successors of Alexander the Great who had become their rulers.


## #7: Fountain
Zechariah promises that when the people of Jeru­salem repent, the Lord will provide a **fountain**, or spring, that will cleanse them from their sins ([13:1](https://www.esv.org/Zechariah+13%3A1/)). They were unclean because they had worshiped idols, but when they repented, God would forgive them.
