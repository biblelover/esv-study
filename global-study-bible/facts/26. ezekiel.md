# Ezekiel Facts

## #1: Babylonians
The **Babylonians** exiled people from Judah and Jerusalem in stages. Daniel and his friends were taken in 605 b.c. Ezekiel was deported in 597 b.c., along with King Jehoiachin and many others ([2 Kings 24:8–17](https://www.esv.org/2+Kings+24%3A8%E2%80%9317/)). The final exile occurred 10 years later.


## #2: Son of man
**Son of man** (or “son of Adam”) highlights the prophet’s humanity before the holy God. Ezekiel is called “son of man” 93 times in this book. 


## #3: Tel-abib
**Tel-abib** was located along the Chebar canal near Babylon. Ezekiel settled there with a community of fellow deportees from Judah ([3:15](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+3%3A15/)). Many exiles prospered in Babylon, and when the Persians allowed them to return to Jerusalem, many decided to stay.


## #4: Act out his prophetic message
God sometimes asked Ezekiel to **act out his prophetic message**. In ch. [4](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+4%3A1%E2%80%9317/), God asks him to lie on his side for 430 days. In ch. [5](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+5%3A1%E2%80%9317/), Ezekiel shaves his beard, a shameful act for a priest, to warn the people that God would judge Jerusalem for its rebellion.


## #5:  the Day of the Lord
God sent the prophets to warn Israel that** the Day of the Lord** was coming, when God would judge his people for their rebellion against him (see [3:19](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+3%3A19/); [Amos 5:18–20](https://www.esv.org/Amos+5%3A18%E2%80%9320/); [Isa. 2:12](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+2%3A12/)). Here Ezekiel specifically condemns Jerusalem’s crime and violence ([7:23](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+7%3A23/)).


## #6: Writing case
A **writing case** ([9:2](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+9%3A2/)) was standard equipment for scribes. The case provided a surface for writing upon and a place for storing pens and ink. It also contained a knife for keeping the pens sharp.


## #7: Hearts of flesh to replace hearts of stone
**Hearts of flesh to replace hearts of stone.** The Lord says that his rebellious people have a “heart of stone” ([11:19](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+11%3A19/)), but he promises to someday give them a “heart of flesh,” enabling them to love and obey him.


## #8: Zedekiah
Though **Zedekiah** was king of Judah at the time, Ezekiel refused to call him king. Instead, he calls him “the prince in Jerusalem” ([12:10](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+12%3A10/)). This is because Zedekiah was a “puppet king” placed on the throne by the Babylonians.


## #9: “prophesy out of their own hearts”
The women in [13:17](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+13%3A17/) who **“prophesy out of their own hearts”** were false prophets and magicians. Unlike Miriam ([Ex. 15:20](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+15%3A20/)), Deborah ([Judg. 4:4](https://www.esv.org/Judges+4%3A4/)), and Huldah ([2 Kings 22:14](https://www.esv.org/2+Kings+22%3A14/)), these female prophets did not speak God’s words.


## #10: Vine
Ezekiel compares the Jerusalemites to a **vine** that can only be used as fuel for a fire (ch. [15](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+15%3A1%E2%80%938/)). In the Bible, the people of God are often compared to a vine. Jesus describes his relationship with his followers using vine imagery in [John 15:1–11](https://www.esv.org/John+15%3A1%E2%80%9311/).


## #11: A “fable” with an important message
**A “fable” with an important message.** Ezekiel’s story about the two eagles, the cedar tree, and the vine could be considered a type of “fable.” A fable is a story in which animals or plants are the main characters. Though they are sometimes entertaining to read, biblical fables teach important lessons.


## #12: Are God’s judgments fair?
**Are God’s judgments fair?** Some of the exiles complained that God was punishing them for their parents’ sins (ch. [18](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+18%3A1%E2%80%9332/)). Ezekiel replies that God will not judge on the basis of a parent’s sins; neither will he forgive because of a parent’s righteousness. God’s judgement is fair.


## #13:  swearing an oath
The Hebrew word for** swearing an oath** ([20:5](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+20%3A5/)) literally means “I raised my hand.” In courtrooms today, people are asked to raise their right hand as they take an oath, promising to tell the truth.


## #14: Parables
Like Jesus, the prophets sometimes used **parables** to explain their messages. Parables convey a message by comparing one thing with another. Ezekiel apparently found the parable God gave him in [20:49](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+20%3A49/) particularly difficult to deliver (see also [17:2](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+17%3A2/)).


## #15: Strange religious practices
**Strange religious practices.** The pagan King Nebu­chadnezzar employed three means of divination to decide what he should do ([21:21](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+21%3A21/)). Shaking arrows is similar to casting lots. The teraphim are household gods (small figurines). “Looking at the liver” means examining the liver of a sacrificed animal.


## #16: Samaria
**Samaria** was defeated by the Assyrians in 722 b.c., bringing the northern kingdom of Israel to an end. Judah’s final defeat came in 587 b.c. Ezekiel portrays the two kingdoms as two sisters (ch. [23](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+23%3A1%E2%80%9349/)). Their unfaithfulness to God caused their defeat.


## #17: Mourn
When Ezekiel’s wife suddenly dies, God tells him not to **mourn**. This was to be a sign to the people that they should not mourn when their beloved temple is destroyed. God asked Ezekiel to do difficult things in order to warn his people.


## #18: A prophecy fulfilled
**A prophecy fulfilled.** The city of Tyre was on an island about a half mile from the coast, with some of its people living in villages on the mainland. Alexander the Great conquered Tyre by first destroying those villages and then using the rubble to build a causeway to the island fortress. This fulfilled Ezekiel’s prophecy that Tyre’s stones, timber, and soil would be cast into the midst of the water ([26:12](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+26%3A12/)).


## #19: Tyre’s wealth
**Tyre’s wealth** came through its port, where it received goods from all around the Mediterranean—often items other nations did not have access to ([28:1–10](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+28%3A1%E2%80%9310/)). Their pride in their wealth would lead to their destruction.


## #20: Hooks in your jaws
**Hooks in your jaws** ([29:4](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+29%3A4/)) is a reference to crocodile hunting. Large hooks were baited with pork and cast into the river. When a crocodile bit the baited hook, it was quickly hauled to shore.


## #21: A tree cut down
**A tree cut down.** The Assyrians believed that a sacred tree, whose roots were fed by a vast underground ocean, brought life to its nation. When Ezekiel talked about this “tree” being cut down ([31:1–18](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+31%3A1%E2%80%9318/)), he was symbolically describing the end of once-mighty Assyria.


## #22: Lions and dragons
**Lions and dragons.** Egypt saw itself as a lion, a nation that hunted and devoured other nations. But Ezekiel compares Egypt to a dragon—a near-sighted crocodile that stirs up muddy waters, attracting attention to itself. Egypt’s boasting will be its downfall, as the Lord sends Babylon to conquer and humiliate it.


## #23: Watchmen
**Watchmen.** The Lord appointed Ezekiel to be a “watchman” over Israel ([33:7](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+33%3A7/)). People depended on the watchman not only to remain vigilant but also to sound the alarm if the city was in danger. It was then up to the people to decide whether to heed these warnings or ignore them.


## #24: Shepherds of Israel
God called his people’s leaders the **shepherds of Israel**. But instead of protecting and providing for their sheep, they abused them. God promised to judge the shepherds, rescue his sheep, and appoint a shepherd like David ([34:23](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+34%3A23/); compare [John 10:11–18](https://www.esv.org/John+10%3A11%E2%80%9318/)).


## #25:  light to the nations
Israel was called to be a** light to the nations** ([Isa. 42:6](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+42%3A6/)), but instead, their sinful behavior “profaned” God’s name before their unbelieving neighbors ([Ezek. 36:22–23](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+36%3A22%E2%80%9323/)). The Lord expects his people to bring honor to his name all around the globe.


## #26: Valley of dry bones
Although Jerusalem was defeated ([33:21–22](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+33%3A21%E2%80%9322/)), Ezek­iel preaches a message of hope in chs. [33–48](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+33%3A1%E2%80%9348%3A35/). In ch. [37](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+37%3A1%E2%80%9328/), his vision of a **valley of dry bones** promises that God’s Spirit will restore Israel. This is one of the most famous passages in Ezekiel.


## #27: Gog and Magog
**Gog and Magog.** In chs. [38–39](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+38%3A1%E2%80%9339%3A29/), Ezekiel prophesies that a mysterious ruler called Gog from an unknown land called Magog will attack Israel. There are many suggestions about who and what Gog and Magog mean, but no agreement has been reached.


## #28: The prophecy in chs. 40–48
**The prophecy in chs. [40–48](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+40%3A1%E2%80%9348%3A35/)** is one of the most difficult passages in the Bible. But certain points are clear. It looks forward to a time when God will dwell among his people. It also emphasizes his supremacy in all things.


## #29: The Lord returns to his temple
**The Lord returns to his temple.** Because of the people’s rebellion, the glory of the Lord departed from the temple in Ezekiel’s vision ([10:18–22](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+10%3A18%E2%80%9322/)). But later Ezekiel has a vision in which God returns to the temple ([43:1–5](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+43%3A1%E2%80%935/)), beginning a new era in his relationship with his people. In the NT, the apostle Paul teaches that those who believe in Christ are the “temple” in which God is pleased to dwell ([1 Cor. 3:16](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+3%3A16/)).


## #30: The prince
**The prince** ([44:3](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+44%3A3/)) in the visions of restoration is also called God’s servant David ([34:23–24; 37:24–25](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+34%3A23%E2%80%9324%2C+37%3A24%E2%80%9325/)). This prince will rule over God’s people forever. Jesus’ followers viewed him as this promised ruler ([Matt. 1:1](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+1%3A1/); [Luke 18:38](https://www.esv.org/Luke+18%3A38/)).


## #31: Passover
The **Passover** described by Ezekiel is quite different than the one first observed in [Exodus 12](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+12%3A1%E2%80%9351/). The original Passover was a time to remember how death had passed over the Israelites before their exodus from Egypt. This new Passover emphasizes offerings to atone for sin ([45:21–24](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+45%3A21%E2%80%9324/)).


## #32: The Dead Sea
**The Dead Sea** is the saltiest body of water in the world. Nearly 35 percent salt, it is six times saltier than the ocean and twice as salty the Great Salt Lake in Utah. In Ezekiel’s vision, the water from the temple turned the Dead Sea into fresh water ([47:8](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+47%3A8/)). This is a picture of how the Lord Jesus Christ can give life to those who were dead in sin ([Eph. 2:1–5](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+2%3A1%E2%80%935/)).
