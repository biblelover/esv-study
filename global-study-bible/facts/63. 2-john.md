# 2-John Facts

## #1: The elder
**The elder** (v. [1](https://www.esv.org/2+John+1/)) is clearly a self-description of the apostle John. “Elder” was a common term for a pastoral leader in the early church (see [Titus 1:5](https://www.esv.org/Titus+1%3A5/); [1 Pet. 5:1](https://www.esv.org/1+Peter+5%3A1/)). Although “elder” does not imply “elderly,” John himself was probably quite old when he wrote this letter.
