# Zephaniah Facts

## #1: Near the end
**Near the end.** Zephaniah was written during Josiah’s reign (640–609 b.c.), after Assyria had defeated Israel. The prophet warns that God will also judge Judah. Soon thereafter, Babylon invaded Judah, eventually destroying it in 586 b.c.


## #2: Mortar
The **Mortar** mentioned in [1:11](https://www.esv.org/Zephaniah+1%3A11/) was probably one of Jerusalem’s market districts. It probably got its name from being located in a valley shaped like a mortar that is used for grinding things with a pestle.


## #3: Palestine
The name **Palestine** is actually derived from the word Philistine. The Philistines migrated to Palestine from Crete. They are also called Cherethites (see [1 Sam. 30:14](https://www.esv.org/1+Samuel+30%3A14/)).


## #4: Rivers of Cush
The **rivers of Cush** mentioned in ch. [3](https://www.esv.org/Zephaniah+3%3A1%E2%80%9320/) are the Blue Nile and the White Nile, the two major tributaries of the Nile River, which flows northward through Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea. The Blue Nile is 900 miles (1,450 km) long and begins its northward journey in Ethiopia. The White Nile is 2,300 miles (3,700 km) long, flowing all the way from Lake Victoria in Uganda.
