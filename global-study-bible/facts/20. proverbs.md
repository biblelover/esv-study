# Proverbs Facts

## #1: Wisdom
**Wisdom** is a key term in [Job](https://www.esv.org/Job+1%3A1%E2%80%9342%3A17/), [Proverbs](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+1%3A1%E2%80%9331%3A31/), and [Ecclesiastes](https://www.esv.org/Ecclesiastes+1%3A1%E2%80%9312%3A14/). The word can mean “skilled at making sound decisions in life.” [Proverbs 9:10](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+9%3A10/) states that “the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.”


## #2: Proverbs
In biblical times, **proverbs** were often used as a means of instruction for young people.


## #3: shalom
The Hebrew word for peace is ****shalom****. It means much more than just the absence of conflict and turmoil. It means that “all is well” in a person’s life.


## #4: Garlands
**Garlands** were wreaths woven from leaves and flowers. They were worn around the head or neck during various celebrations such as weddings. They were also symbols of honor for military success. In [Proverbs](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+1%3A1%E2%80%9331%3A31/), they symbolize the honor that comes from following the way of wisdom ([4:9](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+4%3A9/)).


## #5: Cisterns
**Cisterns** ([5:15](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+5%3A15/)) are underground chambers used to collect and store runoff water from rain and seasonal floods.


## #6: Ants
Despite their small size, **ants** are a picture of wisdom and initiative ([6:6–8; 30:25](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+6%3A6%E2%80%938%2C+30%3A25/)). Ant colonies can reach populations of more than half a million, and will work tirelessly during the harvest season to store food for the winter.


## #7: The simple person
**The simple person** ([7:7](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+7%3A7/)) is one of the primary character types described in the book of [Proverbs](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+1%3A1%E2%80%9331%3A31/). The term describes someone who is immature and easily misled ([14:15](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+14%3A15/)).


## #8: Seven pillars
The fact that the house of Wisdom has **seven pillars** ([9:1](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+9%3A1/)) could signify perfection. Or, it could simply mean that Wisdom’s house is large and impressive.


## #9: Vinegar
**Vinegar** ([10:26](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+10%3A26/)) is wine that has soured. Though generally made from grapes, vinegar can be made with many different fruits. It was often used for seasoning food and bread ([Ruth 2:14](https://www.esv.org/Ruth+2%3A14/)).


## #10: A different kind of security
**A different kind of security.** In biblical times, if a person was unable to pay his debt, the consequences could be serious. The whole family could be sold into slavery. If someone put up “security” for another person, he promised to pay that person’s debt if he was unable to do so himself. [Proverbs](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+1%3A1%E2%80%9331%3A31/) teaches that putting up security for another person is generally unwise, since those who do so risk losing everything if the other person cannot pay his debt ([11:15](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+11%3A15/)).


## #11: What is an “abomination”?
**What is an “abomination”?** When the Bible refers to something as an “abomination” ([12:22](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+12%3A22/)), it means that it is repulsive or detestable to the Lord. Things that are an abomination are contrary to the will of God and his commandments.


## #12: What does it mean to be prudent?
**What does it mean to be prudent?** The “prudent” person ([13:16](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+13%3A16/)) is one who uses good sense. A prudent person carefully thinks through situations and their possible consequences and acts accordingly. Prudence also involves carefully managing resources so that one has what is needed in the future.


## #13: Tents
**Tents** were the most common type of housing in biblical times, as is the case in some parts of the world today. The simple structure and sparse furnishings made them easy to move from place to place. Tents were made by setting poles in the ground, then stretching animal skin or cloth over the poles. Curtains could be used inside the tent to divide it into rooms. Mats often covered the floor, with an open area left in the middle for building a fire.


## #14: Thorns
**Thorns** grew abundantly in the lands of the Bible ([15:19](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+15%3A19/)). In both the OT and NT, thorns were used as instruments of torture and punishment. During the crucifixion, Roman soldiers mocked Jesus by placing a crown made from thorns on his head ([Matt. 27:29](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+27%3A29/)).


## #15: Fountains
The **fountains** of ancient Israel ([16:22](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+16%3A22/)) were not the decorative kind seen today. A fountain was a natural spring-fed pool and was considered a treasure in the arid climate. Cities were often built around such water sources.


## #16: Bribe
A **bribe** is anything that is given with the intent of persuading someone to act in a person’s favor. Bribes were forbidden in [Ex. 23:8](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+23%3A8/). The poor often lost their cases in court because they could not afford to bribe the judge ([Prov. 17:23](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+17%3A23/)).


## #17: Casting lots
**Casting lots.** Though quarrels were often settled by a judge’s decision, sometimes there was not enough evidence to reach a verdict. In such cases, the parties involved might cast lots, trusting that the Lord himself would decide the result ([18:18](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+18%3A18/)). Lots were like the dice used in various games today.


## #18: A false witness
**A false witness** is someone who testifies dishonestly against another person ([19:5](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+19%3A5/)).


## #19: Unequal weights
**Unequal weights.** The price for some goods was fixed according to their weight. If the seller’s scales were unequal ([20:23](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+20%3A23/)), the buyer could be charged far more than the fair price of the goods.


## #20: Weighing the heart
The concept of **weighing the heart** ([21:2](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+21%3A2/)) originated in Egypt. Egyptians believed that when a person died, the gods placed that person’s heart on a set of golden scales along with the Feather of Truth. If the heart weighed less than the feather, the person was admitted into the afterlife. It is possible that the Israelites brought this imagery with them when they left Egypt and replaced the Egyptian gods with Yahweh, who is the true judge of the heart.


## #21: Landmarks
**Landmarks** ([22:28](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+22%3A28/)) were boundary stones placed on each corner of a person’s property to show where it began and ended.


## #22: Mixed wine
**Mixed wine.** Since the process of distillation had not yet been invented, the wine of ancient Palestine had a low alcoholic content. Sometimes, people added various herbs and spices to the wine to increase its potency. The drunkenness described in [23:29–35](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+23%3A29%E2%80%9335/) could have been caused by drinking such “mixed wine” (v. [30](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+23%3A30/)).


## #23: Kisses the lips
The phrase **kisses the lips** in [24:26](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+24%3A26/) probably has more to do with respect and friendly affection than with any idea of romance. The proverb teaches that speaking honestly to a person is one way of showing respect and affection.


## #24: Rains from the north
**Rains from the north.** In Palestine, winds from the north usually bring good weather. When the north wind brings rain, as in [25:23](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+25%3A23/), the rain can be sudden and damaging. Thus it is compared here to a “backbiting tongue.”


## #25: Glazing over the truth?
**Glazing over the truth?** As in modern times, clay pottery was often glazed to improve its appearance. But glaze could also be used to hide poor craftsmanship. It is this dishonest use that is described in [26:23](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+26%3A23/).


## #26: What is a crucible?
**What is a crucible?** In the ancient world, a crucible ([27:21](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+27%3A21/)) was a bowl-shaped instrument used to hold metals such as gold and silver for the refining process. The crucible had to withstand the high temperatures needed to melt out the impurities within the metals. Materials such as clay or stone were used as crucibles.


## #27: Gluttony
**Gluttony** refers to excessive eating. The Bible condemns gluttony as well as drunkenness. [Proverbs](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+1%3A1%E2%80%9331%3A31/) teaches that eating and drinking in excess can lead to poverty ([23:19–21](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+23%3A19%E2%80%9321/)).


## #28: Hezekiah’s contribution to Proverbs
**Hezekiah’s contribution to [Proverbs](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+1%3A1%E2%80%9331%3A31/).** Although most of the [Proverbs](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+1%3A1%E2%80%9331%3A31/) were collected or written by King Solomon, who reigned from 971–931 b.c., the book of [Proverbs](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+1%3A1%E2%80%9331%3A31/) did not exist in its present form until the time of King Hezekiah, some 200 years later. Hezekiah and “his men,” probably his scribes, recorded chs. [25–29](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+25%3A1%E2%80%9329%3A27/).


## #29: Rock badgers
**Rock badgers** are small cliff-dwelling animals closely resembling guinea pigs. They live and forage for food in large groups and are good at hiding. They are best known for posting sentries that alert the group when danger is near. Perhaps it was this mark of wisdom that earned them a mention in [Proverbs](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+1%3A1%E2%80%9331%3A31/) ([30:26](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+30%3A26/)).
