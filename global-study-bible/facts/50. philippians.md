# Philippians Facts

## #1: Imperial guard
The **imperial guard** that Paul mentions in [1:13](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+1%3A13/) was probably the Roman emperor’s group of elite personal bodyguards. Through his imprisonment, Paul was able to tell them about Christ. Because of this, Paul rejoiced even in the midst of his difficult circumstances ([1:18](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+1%3A18/)).


## #2: “hymn of Christ”
The heart of [Philippians](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+1%3A1%E2%80%934%3A23/) is the magnificent **“hymn of Christ”** in [2:5–11](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+2%3A5%E2%80%9311/). Paul poetically describes Jesus’ preexistence and equality with God, his incarnation as a man, his death and resurrection. He is the supreme example of humility and personal sacrifice for the sake of others ([2:3–5](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+2%3A3%E2%80%935/)).


## #3: Encouragement
**Encouragement** is an important theme in Paul’s letter to the Philippians. The words for “joy” or “rejoice” occur more than a dozen times in this brief letter.


## #4: Caesar’s household
**Caesar’s household** ([4:22](https://www.esv.org/Philippians+4%3A22/)) could refer either to the “royal family” or to anyone connected with the emperor’s service. This could include soldiers, slaves, and freedmen, who were most likely the crowd Paul was speaking of. Apparently even people within the imperial household were trusting in Christ.
