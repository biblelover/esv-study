# Titus Facts

## #1: Famous liars
**Famous liars.** Paul quotes a Cretan author who admits that the people of his own nation had a reputation for not telling the truth ([1:12](https://www.esv.org/Titus+1%3A12/)). In fact, the Greeks even coined the word “Cretanize,” which meant dealing falsely with people.


## #2: What is theology?
**What is theology?** Theology is the study of God. Biblical theology attempts to make accurate statements about God based on what he has revealed about himself in Scripture. Accurate knowledge of the Bible is especially important in responding to the kind of false teachings that Paul talks about in his letter to Titus.
