# 1-Corinthians Facts

## #1: Apollos
**Apollos** ([1:12](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+1%3A12/)) was a Jew from the city of Alexandria. He was “an eloquent man, competent in the Scriptures” ([Acts 18:24](https://www.esv.org/Acts+18%3A24/)). At Ephesus, Aquila and Priscilla helped Apollos to better understand the gospel. From Ephesus he traveled on to Corinth, where the church benefited greatly from his teaching ([1 Cor. 3:6](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+3%3A6/)).


## #2: The wisdom of men and the power of God
**The wisdom of men and the power of God.** Mere intellectual persuasion does not save people. Saving faith is produced by the heart-changing power of the Holy Spirit as the gospel is proclaimed ([2:5](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+2%3A5/)).


## #3:  pastoral letter
[First Corinthians](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+1%3A1%E2%80%9316%3A24/) is a** pastoral letter** to a spiritually troubled church. Paul deeply loved the church at Corinth, but he was distressed by some of the behavior prevalent among its members. He wrote to the Corinthians to address such issues as the relationship between Christians and the surrounding culture, divisions within the church, and matters of personal morality.


## #4: What is a “steward”?
**What is a “steward”?** A steward ([4:1–2](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+4%3A1%E2%80%932/)) is someone who serves as an administrator or overseer of something that belongs to someone else. All that we possess ultimately belongs to God. Because of this, everything he has given to us during our time on earth must be managed with great care. This includes our finances, possessions, time, and gifts.


## #5: Leaven
**Leaven** is fermented or soured dough that is added in small amounts to a larger portion in order to make it rise. In the NT, leaven often symbolizes sin that goes undisciplined or unchecked and thus negatively affects the church as a whole ([5:6–8](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+5%3A6%E2%80%938/)).


## #6: What is a “freedman”?
**What is a “freedman”?** A released bondservant was officially designated a “freedman” ([7:21–22](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+7%3A21%E2%80%9322/)). Bondservants were often paid and some were able eventually to buy their freedom.


## #7: Speaking for free
**Speaking for free.** Traveling speakers and teachers were a common sight in Paul’s day. Some of them openly used their speaking skills to seek fame and fortune. Others claimed to despise materialism while privately pocketing large sums of money. Paul distinguished himself from such dishonest people by earning his own living through manual labor ([9:18](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+9%3A18/); compare [1 Thess. 4:11](https://www.esv.org/1+Thessalonians+4%3A11/)).


## #8: The right way to observe the Lord’s Supper
**The right way to observe the Lord’s Supper.** Wealthy Corinthians in the church were apparently treating the Lord’s Supper as an opportunity to display their elite social status ([11:21–23](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+11%3A21%E2%80%9323/)). Paul reminds them of the true meaning of this important Christian observance (vv. [24–34](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+11%3A24%E2%80%9334/)).


## #9: The greatest is love
**The greatest is love.** Jesus said that Christians should be famous for their love for each other ([John 13:34–35](https://www.esv.org/John+13%3A34%E2%80%9335/)), but the Corinthian church was becoming known for its divisions and arguments (see [1 Cor. 3:3; 6:1; 11:18](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+3%3A3%2C+6%3A1%2C+11%3A18/)). Paul tells them what Christian love should look like (ch. [13](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+13%3A1%E2%80%9313/)).


## #10: “build up” the church
When the church meets, it should be to worship the Lord and to **build up the church** ([14:12, 17](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+14%3A12%2C+14%3A17/)). “Building up” includes using words and actions to edify and instruct others, or to make others stronger and more mature in Christ.


## #11: Speaking the truth in an understandable way
**Speaking the truth in an understandable way.** When Paul said, “Bad company ruins good morals” ([15:33](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+15%3A33/)), he was probably quoting the words of a famous Athenian playwright. This is similar to Paul’s sermon in Athens ([Acts 17:22–31](https://www.esv.org/Acts+17%3A22%E2%80%9331/)), where he quotes from non-Christian writers. Christians can often share God’s truth with nonbelievers by relating it to ideas with which they are familiar.


## #12: I, Paul
**I, Paul.** Paul typically used a scribe or secretary to write down his letters as he dictated them. However, in order to remove any doubt that the letter reflected his actual thoughts and words, Paul would often sign his own name at the end ([16:21](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+16%3A21/)).
