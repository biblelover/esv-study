# Genesis Facts

## #1: In the Beginning
In the Hebrew Bible, the title of [Genesis](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+1%3A1%E2%80%9350%3A26/) is **In the Beginning**, the book’s first words. The English title is related to the Greek word **genesis**, which means “beginning.”


## #2: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
**Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.** God said, “Let **us** make man” ([1:26](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+1%3A26/)). This phrase could be the Bible’s earliest indication that God exists as three persons in one: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Christians around the world refer to this as the doctrine of the Trinity.


## #3: The Euphrates
**The Euphrates** ([2:14](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+2%3A14/)) is the longest and most important river in southwest Asia. Early settlers depended on the river for commerce and agriculture. The Euphrates and Tigris rivers form what is today the Shatt-al-Arab, a waterway that flows into the Persian Gulf.


## #4: Cherubim
**Cherubim** ([3:24](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+3%3A24/)) are angels who guard holy places. They appear in various places in the Bible. “Cherubim” is the Hebrew plural form of “cherub.”


## #5: Two men who never died
**Two men who never died.** Enoch and Elijah are the only people in the Bible who did not die a natural death. Instead, they were “taken by God.”


## #6: Favor in the eyes of the Lord
**Favor in the eyes of the Lord.** “Favor” ([6:8](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+6%3A8/)) is another word for God’s grace. Of all the people living at the time of the flood, only Noah and his family found favor in God’s sight.


## #7: Why did Noah take seven pairs of each clean animal but only one pair of each unclean animal?
**Why did Noah take seven pairs of each clean animal but only one pair of each unclean animal?** After the flood, some clean animals were needed for making sacrifices and for food. To ensure their survival, it was necessary to have more than one pair of each kind in the ark.


## #8: Extending an olive branch
**Extending an olive branch.** The universal symbol for peace—a dove with an olive branch—is based on the Bible story of the flood ([8:11](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+8%3A11/)).


## #9: Sinful pride and rebellion
**Sinful pride and rebellion** against God brought negative consequences to the builders of the Tower of Babel, introducing the many languages that now exist around the world.


## #10: What did the Tower of Babel look like?
**What did the Tower of Babel look like?** The Tower of Babel ([11:1–9](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+11%3A1%E2%80%939/)) probably resembled the ziggurats of ancient Mesopotamia. The most famous of these is the Great Ziggurat of Ur. Its remains can be seen today in southeastern Iraq.


## #11: Altars
**Altars** were tables or platforms used for presenting sacrifices to God. They could be built of stone, mud-brick, or dirt mounds. The first altar mentioned in the Bible is the one Noah built after the flood ([8:20](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+8%3A20/); see also [12:8](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+12%3A8/)). 


## #12: Believed the Lord
Abram **believed the Lord**, and that was the basis for God counting him as righteous. Such faith remains the basis for God’s justification of Christians in the NT ([Gal. 2:16](https://www.esv.org/Galatians+2%3A16/)).


## #13: Non-Levite priests?
**Non-Levite priests?** Melchizedek ([14:17–21](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+14%3A17%E2%80%9321/)) and Jesus Christ are the only approved priests in the Bible who were not Levites. The NT book of [Hebrews](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+1%3A1%E2%80%9313%3A25/) explains why this is important.


## #14: Taking servants as wives
**Taking servants as wives.** It was common in ancient cultures for a married man to take a servant as a wife ([16:3](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+16%3A3/)). But this was contrary to God’s original design for marriage ([2:24](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+2%3A24/)).


## #15: Isaac
**Isaac** means “he laughs.” When Abraham and Sarah heard that they were going to have a son in their old age, they both laughed ([17:17; 18:12](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+17%3A17%2C+18%3A12/)). When Isaac was born, however, they and all their friends laughed with joy ([21:6](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+21%3A6/))!


## #16: The city gate
**The city gate** was a place where leaders made key decisions ([Prov. 31:23](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+31%3A23/); [Lam. 5:14](https://www.esv.org/Lamentations+5%3A14/)). Lot’s presence at the city gate ([Gen. 19:1](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+19%3A1/)) shows that he had a position of importance in Sodom.


## #17: What is the Negeb?
**What is the Negeb?** The Negeb ([20:1](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+20%3A1/)) is a dry area of rolling hills in southern Israel. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob lived there. Hagar sought refuge in the Negeb. Later, it provided refuge for Israelites fleeing from invading armies.


## #18: Why fight over a well?
**Why fight over a well?** Wells are of great importance in the hot, dry climates around the world. Because lack of water was a constant threat, both military generals and civilian travelers would often plan their routes according to the location of wells. (See [21:25–31](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+21%3A25%E2%80%9331/).)


## #19: Two biblical firsts
**Two biblical firsts.** The burial of Sarah ([23:19](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+23%3A19/)) is the first biblical record of a burial. Abraham’s purchase of the burial plot is also the first biblical record of a business transaction.


## #20: Family ties
**Family ties.** Laban took responsibility for his sister Rebekah ([24:29](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+24%3A29/)-51). Apparently their father, who was still alive, was unable to do so.


## #21: Tents
**Tents** were temporary shelters made of cloth and were often woven from black goat’s hair. The tent was held up by ropes and poles. Most tents were rectangular in shape. Because nomadic families moved often, they had little furniture. Tents still provide housing for nomadic peoples living in the Middle East today.


## #22: A father’s blessing
**A father’s blessing** (ch. [27](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+27%3A1%E2%80%9346/)) was not just a symbolic gesture. It established the identity of the heir, granting him all the privileges of that position. The father’s blessing was even seen as in some way shaping his future.


## #23: Giving servants
**Giving servants** as gifts to the bride ([29:24](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+29%3A24/)) was very common in OT times. Doing so provided the newly married woman the help she would need in running a household. Having servants also gave the wife a position of status within her community.


## #24: Why was Laban so upset when his household gods were stolen?
**Why was Laban so upset when his household gods were stolen?** Household gods ([31:30](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+31%3A30/)) had a more practical use than just idol worship. They served as titles of ownership to one’s property and inheritance.


## #25: The Jabbok River
**The Jabbok River.** The Hebrew word for “wrestle” is **abbaq**. This has led many scholars to believe that the Jabbok River ([32:22](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+32%3A22/)) was named after Jacob’s famous wrestling match with God.


## #26: Succoth
The name **Succoth** ([33:17](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+33%3A17/)) means “booths.” A booth was a temporary dwelling resembling a tent or a hut. Most of the people around Succoth were nomads, and they probably lived in tents or booths.


## #27: Terebinths
**Terebinths** are huge, spreading trees that grow to a height of 20–26 feet (6–8 m). They have reddish-green leaves and red berries that grow in clusters. A perfumed, oily resin flows out of the bark when it is cut. Terebinths grow in hot, dry places, and were thus a source of welcome shade to the people of the Bible ([35:4](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+35%3A4/); [Hos. 4:13](https://www.esv.org/Hosea+4%3A13/)).


## #28: A long walk!
**A long walk!** Jacob sent Joseph to see how his brothers were doing, as they tended their sheep ([37:14](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+37%3A14/)). Joseph headed northward, probably walking, and didn’t find his brothers until he came to Dothan (v. [17](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+37%3A17/)). The journey would have been more than 50 miles (80 km)!


## #29: A costly demonstration of grief
**A costly demonstration of grief.** The Hebrew custom of tearing one’s garments ([37:29, 34](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+37%3A29%2C+37%3A34/)) was an expression of grief, often after learning of the death of a loved one. It would surely have had great significance in a day when most people owned very few items of clothing.


## #30: Levirate marriage
**Levirate marriage** is the practice of a man marrying the widow of his deceased brother, if she had no children ([38:8](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+38%3A8/)). A child of this second marriage would provide security for the widow and would carry on the name of the deceased brother.


## #31: Cupbearers
**Cupbearers** ([40:1](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+40%3A1/)) were high-ranking officials who served the kings of the ancient Near East. Their job was dangerous: before bringing any drink to the king, they tasted it to make sure that it had not been poisoned.


## #32: Signets
**Signets** were seals that bore a unique mark representing their owner. Some signets were worn around the neck; others were worn as rings ([41:42](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+41%3A42/)). The signet was pressed into soft clay to leave an impression of its mark. Signet impressions were used to certify important documents.


## #33: Money
**Money** in the form of coins did not come into use until around the sixth century b.c. In Joseph’s time, in the nineteenth century b.c., items such as spices, gems, or precious metals were used as money. 


## #34: “God sent me”
Joseph’s words **“God sent me”** reveal his faith in the providence of God who used his brothers’ evil act for great good—the preservation of Joseph and all his family ([45:7](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+45%3A7/)). That same preserving providence of God is at work today all around the world to govern the lives of God’s people. 


## #35: The Land of Goshen
**The Land of Goshen** probably covered a small area. But it was very fertile and was a good place to raise sheep and cattle ([46:28–34](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+46%3A28%E2%80%9334/)).


## #36: “Do not bury me in Egypt.”
**“Do not bury me in Egypt.”** Once a family burial plot had been established, it was customary for future generations to be buried there as well ([47:29](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+47%3A29/)‑30). This helped to tie the family closer together and also to secure their property rights.


## #37: God’s providence
**God’s providence.** When Joseph’s brothers sold him into slavery, the outcome could have been tragic. But God in his providence brought good out of their evil actions ([50:20](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+50%3A20/)). This was a foreshadowing of God’s bringing the ultimate good—eternal salvation for anyone who will receive it, whatever their ethnic or cultural background—out of the wicked actions of the men who crucified Jesus ([Acts 2:22–24](https://www.esv.org/Acts+2%3A22%E2%80%9324/)).
