# 3-John Facts

## #1: A personal letter
**A personal letter.** John’s letter to Gaius follows the pattern of personal letters of his day: greetings (v. [1](https://www.esv.org/3+John+1/)), a prayer for Gaius’s health (v. [2a](https://www.esv.org/3+John+2/)), the main message (vv. [5–12](https://www.esv.org/3+John+5%E2%80%9312/)), and a brief farewell (vv. [13–15](https://www.esv.org/3+John+13%E2%80%9315/)). John departs from the standard form only in his expression of concern for his friend’s spiritual well-being (vv. [2b–4](https://www.esv.org/3+John+2%E2%80%934/)).
