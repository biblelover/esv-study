# 2-Peter Facts

## #1: Facing death
**Facing death.** As Peter wrote this second letter, apparently he knew that he would die soon ([1:14](https://www.esv.org/2+Peter+1%3A14/)). He was probably martyred during the persecution of Christians following the Great Fire of Rome in a.d. 64. See also [1 Pet. 4:12](https://www.esv.org/1+Peter+4%3A12/).


## #2: What is a “heresy”?
**What is a “heresy”?** The word “heresy” refers to any doctrine that contradicts the teaching of Scripture. The heresy addressed in [2 Peter](https://www.esv.org/2+Peter+1%3A1%E2%80%933%3A18/) also involved sexual permissiveness, greed, and dishonesty. Wrong doctrine often leads to sinful moral choices.


## #3: Like a thief in the night
**Like a thief in the night.** Peter says the return of Christ at the end of time will be unexpected, “like a thief” ([3:10](https://www.esv.org/2+Peter+3%3A10/)). Several other NT passages describe the Lord’s return in this same way (see [Matt. 24:43](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+24%3A43/); [1 Thess. 5:2](https://www.esv.org/1+Thessalonians+5%3A2/); [Rev. 3:3](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+3%3A3/)). Christ’s return will be a welcome surprise, however, for his true disciples.
