# Nahum Facts

## #1: Jonah and Nahum
**Jonah and Nahum.** During the 700s b.c., the prophet Jonah warned the people of Nineveh that God was going to destroy their city. The people repented and were spared from judgment. Over the next century, however, they returned to their sinful ways. Shortly after the warning from Nahum, Nineveh was destroyed.


## #2: Palace
The **palace** mentioned in [2:6](https://www.esv.org/Nahum+2%3A6/) was Sennacherib’s famous “palace without rival.” Built shortly after his reign began, it had more than 80 rooms, many open courts, and even fully irrigated hanging gardens. It is estimated that more than 25 athletic fields could have fit inside the palace. Yet even this great palace would “melt away” when Nineveh was destroyed.


## #3: As safe as Thebes?
**As safe as Thebes?** The people of Nineveh thought no one could destroy their city. Yet they themselves had destroyed the Egyptian city of Thebes, which was also considered indestructible. Nahum reminded the Ninevites of this ([3:8–11](https://www.esv.org/Nahum+3%3A8%E2%80%9311/)) and warned them that it was now their turn to see their great city destroyed.
