# Jeremiah Facts

## #1: Watching like an almond tree
**Watching like an almond tree.** The Hebrew words for “almond” and “watching” are very similar. Because the almond tree was the first tree to bud in spring, it was said to be “watching for spring.” God used the almond branch to teach Jeremiah that he is always watching over his word ([1:11–12](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+1%3A11%E2%80%9312/)), so Jeremiah can trust him.


## #2: Living water
Fresh water that flows from a spring or stream was known as **living water** in Palestine ([2:12–13](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+2%3A12%E2%80%9313/)). It was the best and purest water. Jesus says that he is the source of true living water ([John 4:10–14; 7:38](https://www.esv.org/John+4%3A10%E2%80%9314%2C+7%3A38/)).


## #3: Troubled times
Jeremiah lived during **troubled times**. He became a prophet during the reign of Josiah, who was the last faithful king in Judah’s history. Josiah’s death marked the beginning of the end for the nation of Judah. It would fall within two short decades.


## #4: A sad but faithful servant
**A sad but faithful servant.** Jeremiah was very open about the anguish he suffered as a prophet ([4:19–26](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+4%3A19%E2%80%9326/)). In addition to being devastated by the wickedness of his beloved people, he also suffered much abuse from them. Yet despite his struggles, Jeremiah trusted in the Lord.


## #5: Yokes
**Yokes** are made of wooden bars tied to animals by leather thongs around their necks. This ensured that the two animals would work together to pull a plow. Jeremiah uses the yoke in [5:5](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+5%3A5/) as a symbol of God’s rule in his people’s lives.


## #6: A faithful prophet
**A faithful prophet.** Despite persistent rejection, Jeremiah proclaimed the word of God for at least 40 years. His ministry lasted from a time when Judah still had the opportunity to change its ways and avoid punishment, to the time when judgment finally came as Jerusalem was destroyed and the people went into exile (586 b.c.).


## #7: Temple
Judah considered their **temple** a guarantee of God’s favor, despite their idolatry and wickedness. They accused Jeremiah of blasphemy when he prophesied against Jerusalem. Sadly, Judah’s corrupt worship and failure to repent would eventually lead to the destruction of the temple.


## #8: Wailing women
The **wailing women** mentioned in [9:17](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+9%3A17/) were probably professional mourners. In many ancient cultures, such people were paid to sing or deliver eulogies at funerals.


## #9: God’s storehouses
**God’s storehouses.** Just like around the world today, people in Bible times needed places to store things. The Lord also has “storehouses” ([10:13](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+10%3A13/)), for things like rain and lightning and wind!


## #10: Josiah
Judah’s good king **Josiah** rediscovered the Book of the Law, reinstituted the Passover, and destroyed foreign idols. And yet Jeremiah had to declare that the end was coming for Judah ([11:11](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+11%3A11/)), just as it had for Israel a hundred years before.


## #11: The primary calling of the prophet
**The primary calling of the prophet** was to serve as God’s spokesperson. There were many prophets, however, and they sometimes declared conflicting messages. The way to determine if a prophet was speaking God’s words was to see if the prophecy was actually fulfilled (see [Deut. 18:18–22](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+18%3A18%E2%80%9322/)).


## #12: Noonday attack
A **noonday attack** on a city ([15:8](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+15%3A8/)) was unusual. The heat would have been uncomfortable for soldiers in their armor, and the element of surprise would have been gone. Therefore most raids took place at night. An army probably wouldn’t attack at noon unless it was strong enough to be sure of victory.


## #13: Singleness for a prophetic purpose
**Singleness for a prophetic purpose.** The Lord told Jeremiah not to get married. This was probably intended as a symbolic warning that life would soon be very difficult for people with children ([16:1–4](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+16%3A1%E2%80%934/)).


## #14: Repentance
**Repentance** is mentioned more than a hundred times in Jeremiah. The Lord promised to forgive and heal the people if they turned from their sins ([18:5–11](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+18%3A5%E2%80%9311/)). Few responded to Jeremiah’s call for repentance, but the Lord promised that someday they would respond ([33:14–26](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+33%3A14%E2%80%9326/)).


## #15: Mind or kidneys?
**Mind or kidneys?** The word translated “mind” in [20:12](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+20%3A12/) is actually the Hebrew word for “kidneys” (see esv footnote). Because the kidneys were hidden deep within the body, they were seen as the source of emotions and even wisdom.


## #16: The faithful remnant
**The faithful remnant.** In many places, the Bible speaks of a “remnant,” that is, a relatively small group of people, who will remain faithful to the Lord ([23:3](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+23%3A3/); compare [Ezra 9:8](https://www.esv.org/Ezra+9%3A8/); [Isa. 10:20](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+10%3A20/); [Rom. 11:5](https://www.esv.org/Romans+11%3A5/)).


## #17: Seventy years in Babylon
**Seventy years in Babylon.** Jeremiah saw many of his fellow Judeans exiled to Babylon during his lifetime. He predicted that they would remain there for 70 years ([25:11–12](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+25%3A11%E2%80%9312/)), and [Ezra 1:1](https://www.esv.org/Ezra+1%3A1/) records the precise fulfillment of that prophecy.


## #18: Carchemish
When Nebuchadnezzar defeated the Egyptian army at **Carchemish** in 605 b.c., it marked the beginning of Egypt’s decline as a power in the region and the beginning of Babylon’s rise (see [46:2](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+46%3A2/) and note on [25:19](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+25%3A19/)). Judah fell to Babylon in 586.


## #19: Jeremiah’s unpopular message
**Jeremiah’s unpopular message.** While all the other prophets were predicting victory over Babylon, Jeremiah told the people it was God’s will that they serve Babylon for a certain number of years. Then, God would rescue them and would judge Babylon (ch. [27](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+27%3A1%E2%80%9322/)). Needless to say, Jeremiah’s message did not make him very popular with either the people or the king.


## #20: Why were Israel’s craftsmen taken?
**Why were Israel’s craftsmen taken?** Craftsmen were highly prized by conquering kings ([29:2](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+29%3A2/)). They could provide assistance with the king’s projects as well as offer secrets of the trade that had been passed down through the generations.


## #21: Books
**Books** in the OT could refer to any written material (see [30:2](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+30%3A2/)). Usually this was in the form of papyrus scrolls. Pages were glued together end to end so they could be rolled up. A typical papyrus page was similar to the pages used in printers today. Scrolls were usually around 20 pages long, or roughly 15 feet (4.5 m).


## #22:  from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate
Jeremiah said that Jerusalem would someday be rebuilt** from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate** ([31:38](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+31%3A38/)). This is probably where the Babylonian army broke through the walls of Jerusalem. It was on the north side of the city, where the land was flat. There were steep valleys around the rest of the city, which would have made it harder to invade.


## #23: Sealing documents in earthenware vessels
**Sealing documents in earthenware vessels** ([32:14](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+32%3A14/)) was a common way to preserve them for future generations. The Dead Sea Scrolls, one of the most important biblical archaeological discoveries, were found in vessels similar to the one Jeremiah used.


## #24: Burning of spices during funerals
**Burning of spices during funerals** ([34:5](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+34%3A5/)) served a number of purposes. If a burial was delayed, spices would mask any unpleasant odors. Since they were expensive, spices were also a way of displaying wealth and honoring the memory of the deceased.


## #25: Rechabites
The Lord commended the **Rechabites** for keeping the commandments of their founder (ch. [35](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+35%3A1%E2%80%9319/)), which included abstaining from wine and not building permanent houses. The Rechabites obeyed after being told only once, while the people of Judah continued to disobey the Lord after being warned many times.


## #26: Dungeon cells or cisterns
The **dungeon cells or cisterns** in which Jeremiah was imprisoned (chs. [37–38](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+37%3A1%E2%80%9338%3A28/)) were most likely dark, damp rooms without enough room to stand up in. Cisterns were dug out of rock, had a small opening, and spread out at the bottom. Escape from such a place was virtually impossible.


## #27: Free vineyards
**Free vineyards.** After they conquered Judah and shipped all the leading citizens to Babylon, the Babylonians gave vineyards to some of the poor Judeans who remained in the land ([39:10](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+39%3A10/)). This would have made the people less likely to rebel and would allow them to resume farming after many years of war.


## #28: Geruth Chimham
The town of **Geruth Chimham** ([41:17](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+41%3A17/)) may have been named after the Chimham mentioned in [2 Sam. 19:37–40](https://www.esv.org/2+Samuel+19%3A37%E2%80%9340/) (see also “sons of Barzillai,” [1 Kings 2:7](https://www.esv.org/1+Kings+2%3A7/)), who apparently served King David in a time of great need. It was common for members of the royal court to be paid for their services in land rather than money.


## #29: Tahpanhes
**Tahpanhes** ([43:7](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+43%3A7/)) was a fortified city in the eastern part of the Nile delta, near what is now the Suez Canal. Archaeologists have found a large building that may have served as a governor’s residence. Since all such buildings would have belonged to the state, this may be the “Pharaoh’s palace” mentioned in v. [9](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+43%3A9/).


## #30: Pharaoh Hophra
**Pharaoh Hophra** had a tumultuous nineteen-year reign. To the northeast he faced the Babylonians as they invaded Israel; to the west, the armies of Greece were invading Libya. He sent an army to Jerusalem to assist the Israelites but they were defeated, as were his forces in Libya. His own general overthrew him in 570 b.c., and he was killed in battle three years later, thus fulfilling Jeremiah’s prophesy ([44:30](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+44%3A30/)).


## #31: The balm of Gilead
**The balm of Gilead** ([46:11](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+46%3A11/)) was an ointment used to treat wounds. It was probably made from the sap of a tree.


## #32: Doves
**Doves** are known for hiding their nests in high cliffs and other places difficult to reach ([48:28](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+48%3A28/)).


## #33: Jungle of the Jordan
The **jungle of the Jordan** was the bottommost region of the Jordan Valley. Filled with dense thickets and lush plant life, it provided an ideal hunting ground for animals such as lions ([49:19](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+49%3A19/); compare [12:5](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+12%3A5/)).


## #34: How Babylon fell
**How Babylon fell.** Cyrus captured the well-fortified city of Babylon using a simple but clever plan. The Euphrates River ran directly through the city, and there were spiked gates where it entered and exited. Cyrus’s army dug canals upstream to divert the flow of the river. With the water level lowered, his soldiers slipped under the spiked gates and took the city during the night.


## #35: Taking vengeance for his temple
Babylon was conquered in one night, while the king feasted in pride, using the golden vessels stolen from the temple ([Daniel 5](https://www.esv.org/Daniel+5%3A1%E2%80%9331/)). Jeremiah sees this as the Lord **taking vengeance for his temple** ([Jer. 50:28; 51:11](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+50%3A28%2C+51%3A11/)).


## #36: Ashkenaz
The **Ashkenaz** ([51:27](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+51%3A27/)) were also known as the Scythians. They were nomads famed for their horseback-riding abilities. Most Scythians lived north of the Black Sea but some migrated as far away as northern Iran. It is believed that Attila the Hun was a direct descendant of the Scythians.


## #37: Sieges
**Sieges** were designed with one purpose in mind: to get the citizens of a city to give up without a fight. By surrounding a city, an invader could cut off not only a city’s food and water supply but also any means of escape. Once this was done, it was only a matter of time before thirst and hunger set in.
