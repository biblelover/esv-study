# Joel Facts

## #1: Desert locust
The **desert locust** has been a destructive force that has plagued agricultural production for thousands of years. Winds from the Sahara have been known to carry them across oceans. Their devastation of crops often leads to famine. Joel compares them to a great army.


## #2: The sun shall be turned to darkness
**The sun shall be turned to darkness** could be describing a solar eclipse, but more broadly this refers to the disintegration of the cosmos, which was understood by Jews to be a sign of God’s judgment. Note that when Jesus was on the cross, the earth became dark for three hours, indicating God’s judgment (see [Mark 15:33](https://www.esv.org/Mark+15%3A33/)). 


## #3: Slave trading
**Slave trading** ([3:3](https://www.esv.org/Joel+3%3A3/)) was a big business during wartime. Prisoners of war were regularly sold to slave dealers, who often took them far from their native lands. Most likely they would then be sold to the highest bidder.
