# Joshua Facts

## #1: The Historical Books
**The Historical Books.** Joshua begins the section of the Bible known as the Historical Books. There are 12 Historical Books: [Joshua](https://www.esv.org/Joshua+1%3A1%E2%80%9324%3A33/), [Judges](https://www.esv.org/Judges+1%3A1%E2%80%9321%3A25/), [Ruth](https://www.esv.org/Ruth+1%3A1%E2%80%934%3A22/), [1](https://www.esv.org/1+Samuel+1%3A1%E2%80%9331%3A13/)–[2 Samuel](https://www.esv.org/2+Samuel+1%3A1%E2%80%9324%3A25/), [1](https://www.esv.org/1+Kings+1%3A1%E2%80%9322%3A53/)–[2 Kings](https://www.esv.org/2+Kings+1%3A1%E2%80%9325%3A30/), [1](https://www.esv.org/1+Chronicles+1%3A1%E2%80%9329%3A30/)–[2 Chronicles](https://www.esv.org/2+Chronicles+1%3A1%E2%80%9336%3A23/), [Ezra](https://www.esv.org/Ezra+1%3A1%E2%80%9310%3A44/), [Nehemiah](https://www.esv.org/Nehemiah+1%3A1%E2%80%9313%3A31/), and [Esther](https://www.esv.org/Esther+1%3A1%E2%80%9310%3A3/).


## #2: Double walls
**Double walls.** Like several other ancient cities, Jericho was most likely protected by a double wall. Poorer citizens of the city often built their homes between the inner and outer walls.


## #3: The Jordan River
**The Jordan River.** In Hebrew, Jordan means “descending” or “downward.” From Galilee to the Dead Sea the river drops 600 feet (185 m) in 65 miles (105 km). The spring rains and snowmelt from Mount Hermon in the north flood the river, causing it to overflow its banks ([3:15](https://www.esv.org/Joshua+3%3A15/)).


## #4: Circumcision
**Circumcision** was widely practiced in the ancient Near East, though not by every people group. In Egypt, it was considered a rite of passage. For the people of Israel, however, it was a sign of the nation’s covenant with God. Flint or obsidian knives were generally used to perform circumcision.


## #5: Jericho
**Jericho** is one of the oldest cities in the world. At about 750 feet (229 m) below sea level, it is also one of the lowest cities in the world. Jericho receives only a few inches of rainfall each year, and yet it was an oasis for travelers because of its abundant supply of spring water. Jericho is often referred to as the “city of palms” (see [Deut. 34:3](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+34%3A3/)).


## #6: How did the people of Israel consecrate them­selves?
**How did the people of Israel consecrate them­selves?** The people of Israel were often instructed to consecrate themselves in preparation to meet with God. Sanctifying, or “separating” oneself included washing one’s clothes and temporarily abstaining from sexual relations ([3:5](https://www.esv.org/Joshua+3%3A5/); [Ex. 19:14–15](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+19%3A14%E2%80%9315/)).


## #7: Ambush
**Ambush.** Battles were sometimes won by deceptive military strategy rather than by brute strength. If an army had smaller numbers or was unfamiliar with the territory, an ambush ([8:2](https://www.esv.org/Joshua+8%3A2/)) was a great way to “even the odds.”


## #8: Wineskins
**Wineskins** used for storing and pouring wine ([9:13](https://www.esv.org/Joshua+9%3A13/)) were made from the skin of a goat or other animal. Jesus uses wineskins as a metaphor to contrast the outdated religious rules of the Pharisees and the new life that he brings ([Matt. 9:17](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+9%3A17/)).


## #9: Royal humiliation
**Royal humiliation.** In the ancient Near East, victors would often put their feet on the necks of defeated foes ([10:24](https://www.esv.org/Joshua+10%3A24/)). This was usually done to people in positions of leadership. The act was meant to show dominance over the defeated foe.


## #10: How long did it take to conquer Canaan?
**How long did it take to conquer Canaan?** Though the brevity of Joshua’s account may make it seem like a swift military campaign, the conquest of Canaan probably took about seven years.


## #11: Mount Hermon
**Mount Hermon** ([13:5](https://www.esv.org/Joshua+13%3A5/)) represented the northern boundary of the Promised Land. At over 9,000 feet (2,743 m), its snowy peak and thick forests were home to leopards and lions.


## #12: Anakim
**Anakim** were apparently a race of very tall people, descended from Anak. After the Israelites conquered Canaan, many of the Anakim took up residence with the Philistines. Because of this, many assume that Goliath was descended from the Anakim.


## #13: Megiddo
**Megiddo** was the site of many important OT battles. It was a walled city that guarded the main road that linked Egypt and Syria. Its setting made Megiddo a strategic military stronghold. In John’s visions in [Revelation](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+1%3A1%E2%80%9322%3A21/), Megiddo represents the global combat zone where the final battle between Christ and Satan will be fought. The word Armageddon means “Mount Megiddo” ([Zech. 12:11](https://www.esv.org/Zechariah+12%3A11/); [Rev. 16:16](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+16%3A16/)).


## #14: Bethlehem?
**Bethlehem?** There are actually two places called Bethlehem in the Bible. The town where Ruth lived and where Jesus was born was about 5 miles (8 km) south of Jerusalem. The one mentioned in [19:15](https://www.esv.org/Joshua+19%3A15/) was about 7 miles (11 km) northwest of Nazareth, the town where Jesus spent his childhood years.


## #15: Manslayer
A **manslayer** was a person who unintentionally took another person’s life. Such a person could flee to a “city of refuge” ([20:1–6](https://www.esv.org/Joshua+20%3A1%E2%80%936/)) for safety until his case was heard. The term “manslayer” corresponds to the modern use of the term “manslaughter” for unintentional killing.


## #16: Dividing the spoils
**Dividing the spoils** after a war or battle was a very common practice. Livestock, precious metals, clothing, and even people could be taken as spoils. These things were considered gifts from the victor’s gods. In the case of the Israelites, they were considered gifts from the Lord. All gifts were to be shared with allies no matter how much or how little they helped in winning the victory.


## #17: Shechem
**Shechem** was an important center of pagan worship before and during the time of Joshua. It also became important for Israel as the place where they renewed their covenant with the Lord.
