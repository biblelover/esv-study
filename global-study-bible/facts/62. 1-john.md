# 1-John Facts

## #1: Propitiation
**Propitiation** ([2:2](https://www.esv.org/1+John+2%3A2/)) is the appeasement of wrath. God’s holy anger against sin needed to be appeased before sin could be forgiven. By dying on the cross, Christ bore God’s wrath for all who trust in him (see also [Rom. 3:25](https://www.esv.org/Romans+3%3A25/)), anywhere in the world, giving us the ultimate example of love ([1 John 4:10](https://www.esv.org/1+John+4%3A10/)).


## #2: Light
The terms **light** and **darkness** come up often in John’s writing. The light of God’s truth is shining on the darkness of ignorance and sin—and the darkness is passing away ([2:8–11](https://www.esv.org/1+John+2%3A8%E2%80%9311/)).


## #3: Giving to those in need
**Giving to those in need.** Jews in the time of Christ were generous in giving to the needy. In fact, the Jewish historian Josephus remarked that no Jew ever needed to depend on the charity of outsiders. John encourages generosity among Christians as well ([3:17](https://www.esv.org/1+John+3%3A17/)).


## #4: Abide in Jesus
To **abide in Jesus** means living in a daily, close relationship with him, characterized by trust, prayer, obedience, and joy. The Holy Spirit’s presence and activity within Christians gives evidence that they are abiding in Christ ([John 8:31, 6:56, 15:4](https://www.esv.org/John+8%3A31%2C+6%3A56%2C+15%3A4/); [1 John 2:6, 27–28; 3:6](https://www.esv.org/1+John+2%3A6%2C+2%3A27%E2%80%9328%2C+3%3A6/)).


## #5: Eternal life
John wants his readers to know about **eternal life**. Whoever knows and believes in God’s Son and believes he is the Christ, no matter what their cultural or social background, has been born of God and has eternal life ([5:1–12](https://www.esv.org/1+John+5%3A1%E2%80%9312/)).
