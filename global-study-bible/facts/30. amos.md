# Amos Facts

## #1: Earthquakes
**Earthquakes** were a very real danger in ancient Palestine, as is true around much of the earth today. The Jordan River Valley runs along the northern end of the famous Great Rift Valley, which extends all the way to the southernmost part of Africa. Earthquakes occur all along this valley. The findings of archaeologists suggest that the earthquake mentioned in [1:1](https://www.esv.org/Amos+1%3A1/) was one that the Israelites would not have soon forgotten.


## #2: Judgments from the Lord
Amos begins with **judgments from the Lord** on Israel’s neighboring nations: Damascus (Syria), Gaza (Philistia), Tyre (Phoenicia), Edom, Ammon, and Moab ([1:2–2:5](https://www.esv.org/Amos+1%3A2%E2%80%932%3A5/)). God holds all nations accountable for their actions.


## #3: The winter house and summer house
**The winter house and summer house**. Many wealthy Samarians had two homes. One would be in the warmer, southern regions while the other was built in the cooler north ([3:15](https://www.esv.org/Amos+3%3A15/)). This extravagance made it all the more obvious that Amos was justified in his criticism of the wealthy people who ignored the needs of the poor.


## #4: Blighting
The **blighting** of crops ([4:9](https://www.esv.org/Amos+4%3A9/)) was a serious problem for farmers because there was no known way at the time to stop it. Dry winds would blow up from the Sahara at hurricane-like speeds. These dusty winds sucked all moisture out of plant life, leaving the plants themselves brown and wilted.


## #5: Pleiades
Constellations like the **Pleiades** and **Orion** ([5:8](https://www.esv.org/Amos+5%3A8/)) were important to pagan cultures, which worshiped them as gods. Images of them could be found on seals and scrolls throughout the ancient Near East. Prophets like Amos believed that these constellations were not gods, but rather were evidence of the scope and majesty of God’s creation.


## #6: Calves from the midst of the stall
Only the very wealthy could afford to eat the tender meat of **calves from the midst of the stall** ([6:4](https://www.esv.org/Amos+6%3A4/)). These animals were set aside from other livestock and fed a strict diet of the more costly grains like barley in order to fatten them up. This fattening process ensured that the animals would bring a higher price when sold at the market.


## #7: Annual flooding of the Nile
The **annual flooding of the Nile** ([8:8](https://www.esv.org/Amos+8%3A8/)) took place from the months of June to September. Monsoon rains from the mountains to the south would overflow the banks of the Nile, bringing with it the fertile silt from the river. Crops could then be sown in October and harvested in February. This cycle went on for thousands of years until 1970, when Egypt completed construction on the Aswan High Dam, which captures the floodwaters for hydroelectric power.


## #8: Cushites
The **Cushites** ([9:7](https://www.esv.org/Amos+9%3A7/)) lived in the Sudan region, south of Egypt. As far as the Israelites were concerned, the land of Cush was located at the end of the world. Amos mentions the Cushites here to say that even those who live in faraway places are under the Lord’s providential care.
