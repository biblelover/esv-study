## #1: A call to arms
**A call to arms.** Alliances and treaties in the ancient world were important in times of war, just as they are today around the globe. Allies supported each other by combining forces against the enemy. Messengers could be sent to allies requesting soldiers, supplies, and even intelligence on enemy troop movements and strength. In vv. [1â€“14](https://www.esv.org/Obadiah+1%E2%80%9314/), Obadiah warns Edom that it will be destroyed by its former allies.
