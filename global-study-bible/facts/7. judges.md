# Judges Facts

## #1: Toes and Thumbs
**Toes and Thumbs.** Victors in ancient battles would often cut off the thumbs and toes of their foes ([1:6–7](https://www.esv.org/Judges+1%3A6%E2%80%937/)). This would allow their enemies to live but would prevent them from ever participating in another battle.


## #2: Ashtoreth
**Ashtoreth** was the goddess of fertility, love, and war in Canaanite culture. Canaanite legends portray her as Baal’s wife or sister. She is also known by her Greek name, Astarte, and in Mesopotamian texts as Ishtar.


## #3: Cool breezes
**Cool breezes** were rare in the arid climate of ancient Israel. Usually the best place to feel a nice breeze was on the roof of the house. Roofs served many purposes. They provided a place to dry grain and fruit and to store the harvest. They were also a good place to sleep on hot summer nights.


## #4: Chariots of iron
**Chariots of iron.** Iron chariots were the equivalent of tanks in the ancient Near East. They were greatly feared by enemy foot soldiers. Charioteers could run over them, and archers riding in the chariots could hit them from a distance. The only real problem with chariots was that their wheels could get mired in mud.


## #5: Donkeys
**Donkeys** played many roles in the ancient Near East. They provided much of the heavy labor in agriculture and provided personal transportation. The number of donkeys a man possessed often determined his wealth. White donkeys were highly prized ([5:10](https://www.esv.org/Judges+5%3A10/)) because they were rare.


## #6: Camels at war?
**Camels at war?** The Midianites were among the first to use camels in warfare ([6:5](https://www.esv.org/Judges+6%3A5/)). Their camels were most likely the single-humped dromedary, which could travel more than 150 miles (240 km) in one day. The two-humped Bactrian camel was slower but could carry more weight than the dromedary. It was therefore ideal for trade caravans. Camels could be dangerous and unpredictable. If they became angry, they could wreck an entire campsite.


## #7: The night watch
**The night watch.** Watchmen were an important part of life in Bible times. They provided night-time protection both for soldiers in their tents and for ordinary people in their homes.


## #8: Crescents
**Crescents.** Midianite kings often decorated their camels with gold or silver pendants in the shape of a crescent moon ([8:21](https://www.esv.org/Judges+8%3A21/)). They may have believed the crescents were magic, since many of Israel’s neighbors worshiped the moon. Crescents are mentioned in [Isaiah 3:16–18](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+3%3A16%E2%80%9318/) as part of the “finery” that the Lord will take away from the “daughters of Zion.”


## #9: Mount Gerizim
**Mount Gerizim** and Mount Ebal make up the sides of the east-west pass into the Valley of Shechem. When Joshua conquered central Israel, he used these mountains as symbols, pronouncing blessings from Mount Gerizim and punishments from Mount Ebal ([Josh. 8:30–35](https://www.esv.org/Joshua+8%3A30%E2%80%9335/)). Perhaps because of its historical importance, Jotham chose Mount Gerizim as the place to tell his prophetic story about the trees and the bramble bush ([Judg. 9:7–21](https://www.esv.org/Judges+9%3A7%E2%80%9321/)).


## #10: Foolish vows
**Foolish vows.** When Jephthah realized that his foolish vow could result in the death of his daughter ([11:29–40](https://www.esv.org/Judges+11%3A29%E2%80%9340/)), he could have broken the vow. For whatever reason, however, he chose not to break the vow.


## #11: Is it “Shibboleth” or “Sibboleth”?
**Is it “Shibboleth” or “Sibboleth”?** The Gileadites came up with a clever test to distinguish between their friends and their enemies ([12:1–6](https://www.esv.org/Judges+12%3A1%E2%80%936/)). Knowing that the rival Ephraimites spoke a slightly different dialect, they asked them to say the word “Shibboleth.” The Ephraimites pronounced the word with an “s” rather than a “sh” sound, thus making them easy to spot. Today, a “shibboleth” is a word or expression of belief that “insiders” use to determine who is an “outsider.” Thus, if a person doesn’t express his beliefs using just the right words, he may be rejected by a particular group.


## #12: Riddles
**Riddles** were as popular in ancient Near Eastern cultures as they are around the world today. Samson’s riddle about the lion and the honey ([14:5–18](https://www.esv.org/Judges+14%3A5%E2%80%9318/)) is the best example of a riddle in Scripture.


## #13: Were the “foxes” actually jackals?
**Were the “foxes” actually jackals?** The same Hebrew word can mean either “fox” or “jackal.” While foxes usually travel alone, jackals can often be seen roaming in small packs around nightfall. They can be instantly recognized by their wailing, even if they are not seen. It would have been easier for Samson to round up 300 jackals than to catch 300 foxes ([15:4](https://www.esv.org/Judges+15%3A4/)), though neither task would have been easy!


## #14: City gates
**City gates** in Bible times were often very elaborate. Many of them were two stories high or even higher. The actual opening would be narrow, with guardrooms on each side. The gateposts were anchored deep in the ground to support the doors. City gates would often have multiple doors and entrances as well as sharp turns. These were designed to slow down enemies if they tried to get through the gate. They were also the place where business transactions and judicial decisions were made.


## #15: Blinding a prisoner
**Blinding a prisoner** and forcing him to grind grain at a mill ([16:21](https://www.esv.org/Judges+16%3A21/)) was a common form of punishment in the ancient Near East. This is one more example of how the Bible presents an accurate record of the events of its day.


## #16: Laish
**Laish** was about 25 miles (40 km) north of the Sea of Galilee. The Danites would have traveled about a hundred miles (161 km) to reach the city ([18:7](https://www.esv.org/Judges+18%3A7/)). After they invaded and destroyed Laish, the city was renamed Dan ([18:29](https://www.esv.org/Judges+18%3A29/)). For many years thereafter, this city would be considered the northern border of Israel. The nation was often described as extending “from Dan to Beersheba” ([20:1](https://www.esv.org/Judges+20%3A1/)).


## #17: Jebus
**Jebus** ([19:11](https://www.esv.org/Judges+19%3A11/)) was the name of Jerusalem during this time because it was still under the control of the Jebusites. It would stay in the hands of the Jebusites until David conquered it and claimed it for Israel ([2 Sam. 5:6–10](https://www.esv.org/2+Samuel+5%3A6%E2%80%9310/)).


## #18: Slings
**Slings** ([20:16](https://www.esv.org/Judges+20%3A16/)) were weapons made of two long straps, usually either leather or cloth. These were attached to a wider pocket in the middle, where the thrower would place a rock or some other object. The sling was then swung above the head until one of the straps was let go, releasing the rock. Slings were designed to incapacitate the enemy. A fellow soldier with a sword or spear could then deliver the fatal blow.
