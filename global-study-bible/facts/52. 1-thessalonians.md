# 1-Thessalonians Facts

## #1: Grace and peace
Paul began each of his letters with some variation of the phrase **Grace and peace** (see [1:1](https://www.esv.org/1+Thessalonians+1%3A1/)). Peter began his letters in the same way, and John began his second letter that way as well. 


## #2: Thessalonica
**Thessalonica** was the proud capital of the Roman province of Macedonia, with a population of more than 100,000. It was a center of education as well as commerce.


## #3: Jesus’ return
Paul mentions **Jesus’ return** in every chapter of this short letter. In [4:13–18](https://www.esv.org/1+Thessalonians+4%3A13%E2%80%9318/), he tells the Thessalonians what will happen to Christians who already have died. When Christ returns, they will see their loved ones again, and they will all be with the Lord forever (see [4:15–17](https://www.esv.org/1+Thessalonians+4%3A15%E2%80%9317/)).


## #4: Peace and security
The Romans promised **peace and security** to the citizens of their empire. They promoted this message on coins and statues. But Paul warns that, regardless of how secure people may feel, God’s day of judgment will come for those who have rejected him ([5:3](https://www.esv.org/1+Thessalonians+5%3A3/); see [Jer. 8:11](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+8%3A11/)).
