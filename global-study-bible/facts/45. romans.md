# Romans Facts

## #1: A letter to Rome
**A letter to Rome.** Because Romans is Paul’s fullest explanation of his theology, it is easy to forget that Paul wrote it to a particular church in Rome. His letter applies the eternal truth of the gospel to their real-life concerns, but the letter applies today to people all around the globe, from all different kinds of backgrounds, because it is dealing with fundamental truths.


## #2: God’s judgment
**God’s judgment.** Global humanity’s rejection of God is the root of all that is wrong with the world. Since Adam and Eve, everyone has responded to God’s love by doing things he hates. Everyone deserves punishment, but God offers forgiveness through Christ (see [3:23–24](https://www.esv.org/Romans+3%3A23%E2%80%9324/)).


## #3: What does it mean to be “justified”?
**What does it mean to be “justified”?** To be justified means to be declared righteous before God. It means that, as the divine judge, God looks on those who are in Jesus and declares them “guilty as charged, but pardoned and accepted.”


## #4: Transgression
**Transgression** means to disobey a specific com­mand from God. It could refer to a violation of a command in the written law of God ([4:15](https://www.esv.org/Romans+4%3A15/)) or to a verbal command from God, as in the case of Adam ([5:14](https://www.esv.org/Romans+5%3A14/)).


## #5: Peace with God
Those who trust in Christ have **peace with God** ([5:1](https://www.esv.org/Romans+5%3A1/)). God declares them forgiven. They stand securely in God’s grace and salvation rather than his judgment ([5:2, 8–9](https://www.esv.org/Romans+5%3A2%2C+5%3A8%E2%80%939/)).


## #6: Continue in sin
Paul was probably asked, “Does your message about salvation by grace lead people to **continue in sin**?” He explains what baptism symbolizes in the Christian life: Christ’s defeat of sin’s rule and the gift of new life ([6:1–14](https://www.esv.org/Romans+6%3A1%E2%80%9314/)). God changes believers so that they can obey him “from the heart” ([6:17](https://www.esv.org/Romans+6%3A17/)).


## #7: The Spirit lives within them
Even Christians often struggle with sinful desires ([7:7–25](https://www.esv.org/Romans+7%3A7%E2%80%9325/)), but they can be confident that **the Spirit lives within them**, helping them to obey God ([8:1–11](https://www.esv.org/Romans+8%3A1%E2%80%9311/)).


## #8: When Christ returns,
**When Christ returns,** he will fix everything that is broken and hurting ([8:16–39](https://www.esv.org/Romans+8%3A16%E2%80%9339/); see [Rev. 21:1–22:5](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+21%3A1%E2%80%9322%3A5/)). He will restore creation, including every corner of the globe, to its original beauty and wholeness. God will bring dead believers back to life and make all his children perfect like Christ ([Rom. 8:29](https://www.esv.org/Romans+8%3A29/); [1 Thess. 4:13–18](https://www.esv.org/1+Thessalonians+4%3A13%E2%80%9318/)).


## #9: Share the Good News with others
Paul’s love for God and his compassion for those who do not know Christ are clear (see [9:1–5; 10:1, 14–15](https://www.esv.org/Romans+9%3A1%E2%80%935%2C+10%3A1%2C+10%3A14%E2%80%9315/)). Believers’ experience of God’s grace should motivate them to **share the Good News with others** all over the world and to pray that they will believe.


## #10: A wild olive branch?
**A wild olive branch?** Farmers don’t usually graft a wild plant onto a cultivated one, but Paul says that is just what God has done in grafting the wild olive branch of the Gentile world onto the cultivated olive tree of his people Israel ([11:11–24](https://www.esv.org/Romans+11%3A11%E2%80%9324/)). He has done this so that all people everywhere, no matter what earthly family they come from, can become a part of his family.


## #11: What does “discern” mean?
**What does “discern” mean?** To discern something means to understand it. For Christians, discernment involves the use of wisdom and the Holy Spirit’s guidance to figure out how to apply biblical principles to the concrete issues of life ([12:2](https://www.esv.org/Romans+12%3A2/); see also [Eph. 5:10](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+5%3A10/)).


## #12: Should Christians always pay their taxes?
**Should Christians always pay their taxes?** Paul says that paying taxes is one way in which Christians show honor to the authorities God has placed over them ([13:1–7](https://www.esv.org/Romans+13%3A1%E2%80%937/)). Christians should obey their government unless doing so means disobeying the Lord ([Acts 5:29](https://www.esv.org/Acts+5%3A29/)).


## #13: He obviously cared deeply
Paul had not visited Rome when he wrote this letter, but he sent personal greetings to more than 25 individually named men and women plus households ([16:3–15](https://www.esv.org/Romans+16%3A3%E2%80%9315/)). **He obviously cared deeply** for his Christian brothers and sisters and appreciated their work for Christ.
