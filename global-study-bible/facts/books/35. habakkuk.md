# Habakkuk Facts

## #1: The Babylonian horsemen
**The Babylonian horsemen** ([1:8](https://www.esv.org/Habakkuk+1%3A8/)) were greatly feared by the people they fought against. Taking advantage of their great speed, they would scatter the enemy’s foot soldiers and then hunt them down one by one. But even Babylon’s horses couldn’t save Babylon from the Lord’s hand of judgment ([3:16](https://www.esv.org/Habakkuk+3%3A16/)).


## #2: Woe oracles
**Woe oracles.** Verses [6–20](https://www.esv.org/Habakkuk+2%3A6%E2%80%9320/) of ch. [2](https://www.esv.org/Habakkuk+2%3A1%E2%80%9320/) consist of five “woe oracles” against Babylon. Each of these begins with the word “woe” and condemns the Babylonians for violence and idolatry.


## #3: Habakkuk’s final prayer
**Habakkuk’s final prayer** ([3:1–19](https://www.esv.org/Habakkuk+3%3A1%E2%80%9319/)) was written as a song. The musical term “selah,” also found in the psalms, occurs three times. It closes with a note about stringed instruments, which would have included harps and lyres ([Ps. 33:2](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+33%3A2/)).
