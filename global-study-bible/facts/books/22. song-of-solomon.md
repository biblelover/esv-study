# Song-Of-Solomon Facts

## #1: Mare among Pharaoh’s chariots
The man in this love story compared his beloved to a **mare among Pharaoh’s chariots** ([1:9](https://www.esv.org/Song+of+Solomon+1%3A9/)). Only the best and most handsome of mares would have been chosen for important processions, and they would have been well-adorned with jewels and ornaments. This was the man’s way of saying that his beloved’s beauty is incomparable.


## #2: Purple cloth
**Purple cloth** was associated with royalty because the purple dye was very difficult to produce in large quantities. Most of the purple dye came from a shellfish called the murex. It took more than 8,000 murex shellfish to extract one gram of dye.


## #3: Daughters of Jerusalem
The woman addresses the **daughters of Jerusalem** four times throughout this book, creating a refrain that ties her “songs” together ([2:7; 3:5; 5:8; 8:4](https://www.esv.org/Song+of+Solomon+2%3A7%2C+3%3A5%2C+5%3A8%2C+8%3A4/)). She urges them not to “stir up or awaken love until it pleases.” In other words, they should wait until the appropriate time to enjoy romantic love.


## #4: Vineyards, fields, and palm trees
**Vineyards, fields, and palm trees.** The [Song of Solomon](https://www.esv.org/Song+of+Solomon+1%3A1%E2%80%938%3A14/) takes place in a rural setting, and the lovers describe each other using images drawn from this context. The man is a shepherd, and the woman works in her family’s vineyard.
