# Nehemiah Facts

## #1: Cupbearer to the king
**Cupbearer to the king** may sound like a lowly position, but it was actually considered a high office. The cupbearer’s job was to taste any wine brought to the king, in case it was poisoned. The king had to trust his cupbearer with his very life. Because of their trusted position, many cupbearers, such as Nehemiah ([1:11](https://www.esv.org/Nehemiah+1%3A11/)), were able to exert political influence in the royal court.


## #2: The fortress of the temple
**The fortress of the temple** ([2:8](https://www.esv.org/Nehemiah+2%3A8/)) provided extra defense for the temple area, since this section of Jerusalem was very vulnerable to attack. Many other governors of Jerusalem after Nehemiah built fortresses here, including Herod the Great, whose famous Antonia Fortress can be visited today.


## #3: What was the Ophel?
**What was the Ophel?** The Ophel ([3:26](https://www.esv.org/Nehemiah+3%3A26/)) was a hill in Jerusalem between the Kidron and Central Valleys. It was northeast of the older City of David and just south of the Temple Mount. The oldest part of Jerusalem was built long before David captured the city from the Jebusites.


## #4: Why did so many local people oppose Nehemiah?
**Why did so many local people oppose Nehemiah?** After the exile, people who had been living in Judah for over a hundred years saw it as belonging to them and not to the returning Jews. Nehemiah had the blessing of King Artaxerxes to rebuild the walls, but the king was in Persia, more than 1,100 miles (1,770 km) away. This made Nehemiah’s enemies bolder in their opposition to him.


## #5: Mortgage their property
The returned exiles would sometimes **mortgage their property** ([5:3](https://www.esv.org/Nehemiah+5%3A3/)) to raise money for the heavy taxes imposed on them. This mortgaging would have involved temporarily forfeiting the use of one’s property and any fruit it produced to wealthier people who could afford to pay the taxes. The Mosaic law forbade such practices, and Nehemiah was quick to oppose it.


## #6: Open letter
An **open letter** ([6:5](https://www.esv.org/Nehemiah+6%3A5/)) was one that was read to the entire public, not just the individual to whom it was addressed. By publicly claiming that Artaxerxes would be angry about the rebuilding of the walls, Sanballat was hoping to frighten the laborers into ceasing their work.


## #7: Can Nehemiah’s wall be seen today?
**Can Nehemiah’s wall be seen today?** In the 2,500 years since Nehemiah’s day, Jerusalem has been rebuilt, destroyed, and rebuilt again. This has made evidence of Nehemiah’s wall difficult to find. However, a part of the wall can still be seen.


## #8: The Feast of Booths
**The Feast of Booths** ([8:2](https://www.esv.org/Nehemiah+8%3A2/)) marked the end of the agricultural year. It was a time to celebrate God’s provision and to ask his blessing for the next year’s crops. Once every seven years, the Book of the Law of Moses was to be read during the festival. This was done to instruct the children and as a reminder for the adults.


## #9: Word pictures for worship and teaching
**Word pictures for worship and teaching.** Religious images were strictly forbidden under the Mosaic law, but Israel’s leaders often used vivid imagery in their story-telling to teach the people and to help them worship. Chapter [9](https://www.esv.org/Nehemiah+9%3A1%E2%80%9338/) gives an example of this, as the Levites publicly recite the nation’s history, from creation to the present.


## #10: Seals
**Seals** in the ancient Near East (e.g., [10:1](https://www.esv.org/Nehemiah+10%3A1/)) were stamps pressed into soft wax on documents that demonstrated ownership or authorship.


## #11: Why did the small towns of Judah send people to live in Jerusalem?
**Why did the small towns of Judah send people to live in Jerusalem?** In Nehemiah’s time, Jerusalem was only one-fourth the size it had been before the exile. No one wanted to live in a city without defensive walls. Once the walls were completed, however, the community leaders wanted Jeru­salem to become a thriving capital city once again. This meant transplanting citizens from the small towns ([11:1–2](https://www.esv.org/Nehemiah+11%3A1%E2%80%932/)).


## #12: Dedications
**Dedications** were ceremonies performed to consecrate something or someone for service to the Lord.


## #13: Household furniture
Tobiah was not a priest, so moving his **household furniture** into the temple desecrated the area ([13:5, 7](https://www.esv.org/Nehemiah+13%3A5%2C+13%3A7/)). His presence in the temple also meant that one of Nehemiah’s fierce opponents had been given a luxurious home in the temple.
