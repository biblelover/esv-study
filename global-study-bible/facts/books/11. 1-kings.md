# 1-Kings Facts

## #1: Forever
God promised to establish David’s kingdom **forever** ([2 Sam. 7:1–17](https://www.esv.org/2+Samuel+7%3A1%E2%80%9317/)). Although Adonijah was David’s eldest living son, Nathan and Bathsheba’s actions ensured that Solomon’s claim to the throne was stronger (ch. [1](https://www.esv.org/1+Kings+1%3A1%E2%80%9353/)). Solomon became king at David’s death.


## #2: Horns of the altar
**Horns of the altar.** Many ancient Near Eastern cultures regarded shrines and temples as places where a person could seek safety and refuge. In Hebrew culture, a person accused of a crime might grasp the horns of the altar ([1:50](https://www.esv.org/1+Kings+1%3A50/)) to indicate that he was seeking protection from the Lord.


## #3: Why did Adonijah ask for Abishag?
**Why did Adonijah ask for Abishag?** Marrying David’s concubine ([2:17](https://www.esv.org/1+Kings+2%3A17/)) would have given Adonijah a claim to the throne.


## #4: No witnesses
**No witnesses.** Under normal circumstances, priests and judges would have presided over the case between the two prostitutes ([3:16–28](https://www.esv.org/1+Kings+3%3A16%E2%80%9328/)). However, because there were no witnesses to the case, the law required them to go before Solomon. The king was considered to be the highest court of appeal.


## #5: How large was Israel under Solomon’s rule?
**How large was Israel under Solomon’s rule?** During the reign of Solomon, Israel extended into the Sinai desert near Egypt in the south and to the Euphrates River in the north. It was roughly three times the size of Israel today and would have included parts of present-day Lebanon, Jordan, and Syria.


## #6: Dressed stones
**Dressed stones** ([5:17](https://www.esv.org/1+Kings+5%3A17/)) are stones that have been cut and polished so that they have smooth faces and edges. This type of masonry was time-consuming and expensive, so it was used primarily for palaces and temples.


## #7: No tools of iron?
**No tools of iron?** The Lord had forbidden the use of iron tools in the construction of altars ([Ex. 20:25](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+20%3A25/)). As they built the temple, the Israelites used iron tools on the stones only at the quarry, never at the construction site. They probably did this as an expression of reverence for the temple.


## #8: The House of the Forest of Lebanon
**The House of the Forest of Lebanon** was part of Solomon’s palace. It was much larger than the temple and designed to be a treasury or an armory. It got its name from the large amounts of cedar timber used to build it.


## #9: Praying toward Jerusalem
**Praying toward Jerusalem** ([8:29](https://www.esv.org/1+Kings+8%3A29/)) was a practice started by Solomon that many Jews around the world still follow today. It comes from Solomon’s prayer of dedication, where he stated that God is too great to dwell in a temple. However, the Lord stated himself that his name would dwell in the temple forever ([9:3](https://www.esv.org/1+Kings+9%3A3/)), thus providing a symbolic place to which people could direct their prayers.


## #10: Temple
The building and dedication of the **temple** was perhaps the most significant event of King Solomon’s reign. The temple replaced the Tent of Meeting and became the place of worship for Israel. It was a grand monument to God’s glory for all to see.


## #11: Megiddo
The city of **Megiddo** was located on one of the most important trade routes of the ancient Near East. In fact, it was so important that when Egypt’s Pharaoh Thutmose III conquered the city in 1482 b.c. he said that capturing it was like capturing a thousand cities. It was so strategic that Israel’s King Ahab (869-850 b.c.) dug a 120-foot (37-m) deep shaft and a 215-foot-long tunnel to provide water for the city in case it came under siege.


## #12: 666 talents
**666 talents** of gold ([10:14](https://www.esv.org/1+Kings+10%3A14/)) was a lot of gold—nearly 25 tons! Solomon accumulated lots of gold and other valuable resources through his extensive trading with nations all over the known world.


## #13: Damascus
From ancient times, **Damascus** has been a strategic location. It was a primary stopping point along the main caravan route that ran from Africa to Mesopotamia. When it became the capital of the Aramean kingdom (modern Syria), it served as a military outpost to prevent Israel from expanding northward.


## #14: How long did the United Kingdom of Israel last?
**How long did the United Kingdom of Israel last?** All 12 tribes of Israel were together as one nation for a total of 120 years: 40 years under Saul, 40 years under David, and 40 years under Solomon (c. 1050-930 b.c.).


## #15: Lions
**Lions** ([13:24](https://www.esv.org/1+Kings+13%3A24/)) were once plentiful in the ancient Near East. The last recorded sighting of a lion in this area was in the thirteenth century a.d.


## #16: “Man of God,”
**“Man of God,”** meaning “prophet,” is used 37 times in [1](https://www.esv.org/1+Kings+1%3A1%E2%80%9322%3A53/)–[2 Kings](https://www.esv.org/2+Kings+1%3A1%E2%80%9325%3A30/). Though God judged the Judean prophet’s disobedience ([13:1–32](https://www.esv.org/1+Kings+13%3A1%E2%80%9332/)), his prophecy against the temple in Bethel was fulfilled, and King Josiah preserved his burial place ([2 Kings 23:15–20](https://www.esv.org/2+Kings+23%3A15%E2%80%9320/)).


## #17: What were high places?
**What were high places?** High places ([14:23](https://www.esv.org/1+Kings+14%3A23/)) were worship sites for local pagan gods. Before the temple was built in Jerusalem, Israelites often offered sacrifices in such places. After the temple was built, however, people were required to sacrifice there instead of at the high places.


## #18: Queen mother
The role of the **queen mother** was an important one in the royal court. She might serve as an adviser to the king and also as a teacher for his children.


## #19: King Omri
Though the story of **King Omri** is told in just eight verses ([16:21–28](https://www.esv.org/1+Kings+16%3A21%E2%80%9328/)), politically speaking he was one of Israel’s most important kings. He built the capital city of Samaria in a place that gave Israel a strategic advantage over its enemies. After his time, the Assyrians referred to Israel as “the land of Omri.”


## #20: Life for a widow
**Life for a widow** was not easy in the ancient Near East. Widows had difficulty protecting themselves and their children economically, legally, or physically. If the widow became childless, her situation would be even more difficult, since she would have no one to care for her in her old age (see [17:8–24](https://www.esv.org/1+Kings+17%3A8%E2%80%9324/)).


## #21: Why did the prophets of Baal cut themselves?
**Why did the prophets of Baal cut themselves?** According to one ancient Canaanite myth, the father of Baal slashes his chest, arms, and back upon learning of his son’s death. In the myth, Baal returns to life when the rains come. The prophets may have hoped that their actions would bring rain and end the drought.


## #22: Broom trees
**Broom trees** ([19:5](https://www.esv.org/1+Kings+19%3A5/)) are a type of desert shrub common in Palestine, Arabia, and Egypt. Its long branches form a bush that grows to about 12 feet (3.7 m) high. Wood from broom trees makes excellent charcoal.


## #23: Bazaar
The word **bazaar** ([20:34](https://www.esv.org/1+Kings+20%3A34/)) meant “place of prices” in Persian. Bazaars were permanent places designated for merchants and traders to buy and sell goods. Either a part of one street or a whole district of a city would be used as a bazaar.


## #24: Confiscation of land
**Confiscation of land.** Israelite law did not allow the king to confiscate the land of an executed criminal. This was, however, a common practice outside of Israel. Perhaps Jezebel, who came from Tyre, based her plan to seize Naboth’s vineyard on this practice.


## #25: Ahab’s ivory palace
**Ahab’s ivory palace.** Archaeologists have discovered remains of Ahab’s palace ([22:39](https://www.esv.org/1+Kings+22%3A39/)) in Samaria. Beautifully carved ivory fragments with Egyptian and Phoenician designs were found where its main floors and courtyard would have been.
