# Malachi Facts

## #1: Lord
The title **Lord of hosts** appears more frequently in [Malachi](https://www.esv.org/Malachi+1%3A1%E2%80%934%3A6/) than in any other OT book. Following the exile, Judah was a very small province within the vast Persian Empire. It had no army of its own, leaving its people painfully aware of how limited their resources were. Malachi wants to remind his people that God is in command of a great heavenly host that stands ready to defend Judah.


## #2: Blind, lame, and sick animals
**Blind, lame, and sick animals** were financially worthless. The Lord commanded his people to sacrifice healthy animals (see [Deut. 15:21; 17:1](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+15%3A21%2C+17%3A1/)). Disobeying this command showed a lack of respect for the Lord ([Mal. 1:8, 14](https://www.esv.org/Malachi+1%3A8%2C+1%3A14/)).
