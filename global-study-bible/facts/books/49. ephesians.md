# Ephesians Facts

## #1: Ephesus
**Ephesus** was one of the largest cities in the Roman Empire and the primary port for Asia Minor. It boasted an advanced system of aqueducts, a 25,000-seat amphitheater, a major library with more than 12,000 scrolls, and the Temple of Artemis (one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World).


## #2: Salvation by grace
**Salvation by grace.** In [2:1–10](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+2%3A1%E2%80%9310/), Paul eloquently describes how God initiated salvation for unde­serving sinners just because he loves them. Through no merit of their own, he rescued them from slavery to sin and graciously gave them new life in Christ ([1:5](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+1%3A5/)).


## #3: Visions
The apostle Paul received special **visions** from God (see [Acts 22:17–21](https://www.esv.org/Acts+22%3A17%E2%80%9321/); [2 Cor. 12:1–7](https://www.esv.org/2+Corinthians+12%3A1%E2%80%937/); [Gal. 2:2](https://www.esv.org/Galatians+2%3A2/)). In his first vision, he saw the Lord Jesus ([Acts 9:1–7](https://www.esv.org/Acts+9%3A1%E2%80%937/)). One of the mysteries God later revealed in a vision was that the gospel was for both Jews and Gentiles ([Eph. 3:6](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+3%3A6/)).


## #4: Renewed minds
**Renewed minds.** Christians sometimes distinguish between “head knowledge” and “heart knowledge.” But the Bible clearly teaches that we are to love and serve the Lord with all that we are, including both our hearts and our minds ([4:23](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+4%3A23/); see [Deut. 6:5](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+6%3A5/); [Matt. 22:37](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+22%3A37/)).


## #5: Holy lives
Paul makes it clear that Christians must live **holy lives** ([5:1–21](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+5%3A1%E2%80%9321/); see [4:17–24](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+4%3A17%E2%80%9324/)). This means rejecting sexual immorality, impurity, idolatry, coveting, and drunkenness. Instead, they should strive to imitate God, because he loves them ([5:1–2](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+5%3A1%E2%80%932/)).


## #6: Flaming darts
**Flaming darts** ([6:16](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+6%3A16/)) were arrows tipped with cloth, then dipped in pitch and set on fire before shooting. They were used to ignite structures and the shields of opposing infantrymen. In defense against such darts, soldiers often covered their shields with leather and soaked them in water.
