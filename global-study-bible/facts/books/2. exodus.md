# Exodus Facts

## #1: As numerous as the stars
**As numerous as the stars.** As the book of [Exodus](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+1%3A1%E2%80%9340%3A38/) begins, some 350 years have passed since the end of [Genesis](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+1%3A1%E2%80%9350%3A26/). The 70 Israelites who went to Egypt have grown into a great multitude. This fulfills God’s promise to multiply Abraham’s descendants and to make them a blessing to all the nations of the world ([Gen. 12:1–3; 15:5](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+12%3A1%E2%80%933%2C+15%3A5/)).


## #2: Bitumen
**Bitumen** is a mineral found in Mesopotamia and Palestine. It was used as a mortar for setting bricks and for waterproofing rafts and boats ([2:3](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+2%3A3/)).


## #3: Holy
**Holy** means "set apart for God’s special purpose." It is a condition of purity and freedom from sin. When the Bible speaks of God’s holiness it means his utter separateness from everything else that exists, especially from all forms of evil.


## #4: Putting words in his mouth?
**Putting words in his mouth?** When God appointed Aaron as Moses’ spokesperson ([4:16](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+4%3A16/)), Moses was probably already familiar with the idea of someone being the "mouth" of another person. In ancient Egypt, there was a high official known as "the mouth of the king" whose job was to speak to the people of Egypt on behalf of Pharaoh.


## #5: Pharaoh
**Pharaoh.** Egypt’s kings, called pharaohs, had absolute power over everything in Egypt. The OT mentions at least 10 different pharaohs.


## #6: Why was straw needed for making bricks?
**Why was straw needed for making bricks?** To withstand the harsh weather in Egypt, buildings needed especially strong bricks. Mixing straw with the clay allowed the clay to bind together and helped the bricks to dry evenly ([5:10](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+5%3A10/)).


## #7: Lord of all creation
**Lord of all creation.** Each of the 10 plagues showed clearly that the God of Israel was infinitely more powerful than the false gods of the Egyptians.


## #8: River turned to blood
**River turned to blood.** Egypt’s most important gods were associated with the Nile River. Turning the Nile to blood proved that the God of Israel had supreme control of the rivers.


## #9: Frogs
**Frogs.** The Egyptians worshiped the god Hekt, who was portrayed as having the head of a frog.


## #10: Death of livestock
**Death of livestock.** A number of the Egyptian gods were portrayed as having the head of an animal: Apis and Mnevis (bulls) and Khnum (a ram). Isis was depicted with cow horns on her head.


## #11: Was Pharaoh considered a god?
**Was Pharaoh considered a god?** According to some ancient Egyptian sources, each morning the pharaoh would conduct "the Rite of the House of the Morning," a ritual believed to awaken the sun god, causing the sun to rise.


## #12: What is the purpose of a "sign"?
**What is the purpose of a "sign"?** A "sign" is a visible symbol of God’s work on his people’s behalf. Throughout Scripture, God gives signs to his people as reminders of his presence, power, and promises. The blood placed on the doorway of the Israelites’ houses was a sign ([12:13](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+12%3A13/)) that the Israelites were the Lord’s people and that he would protect them from death.


## #13: Redeem
The word **redeem** ([13:13](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+13%3A13/)) means to free someone or something from harm by paying a price. Jesus is the supreme example of redemption in the Bible. He paid the ultimate price—his very life—to bring freedom from sin and eternal life to all who would put their trust in him, irrespective of background.


## #14: Chariots
**Chariots** ([14:23](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+14%3A23/)) were two-wheeled vehicles pulled by horses. They were made of wood and leather. Mainly intended for battle, chariots often had two riders: a driver and a warrior. Chariots were also used for hunting and for transportation. They were symbols of wealth and power. Egyptian pharaohs were sometimes buried with a chariot.


## #15: Manna for Christians today?
**Manna for Christians today?** The manna that appeared each morning with the dew foreshadowed Jesus Christ, who is the true Bread from heaven ([John 6:30–58](https://www.esv.org/John+6%3A30%E2%80%9358/)).


## #16: Who were the Amalekites?
**Who were the Amalekites?** The Amalekites were nomads living in the northern Sinai peninsula. They were the first to attack the Israelites after the exodus. They remained a threat to Israel for hundreds of years.


## #17: On eagles’ wings
**On eagles’ wings.** The kind of eagle that the author of [Exodus](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+1%3A1%E2%80%9340%3A38/) probably had in mind had a wingspan of 8 to 10 feet (2–3 m), making it a fitting symbol of the Lord’s ability to rescue his people from their life of slavery in Egypt.


## #18: How did people end up as slaves?
**How did people end up as slaves?** The word translated "slave" can refer to several types of persons. Debt was the most common reason that people became slaves. The security provided by a good employer led some slaves to choose to remain in that status permanently. In ancient times, people could generally not be bought and sold at will, unlike much of the more horrific slavery in recent centuries around the world. Slavery has continued even to the present day, as vulnerable men, women, and even children are often forced into various kinds of unjust slavery. 


## #19: Restitution
**Restitution.** The Mosaic law decreed that those who caused others to lose property, through either theft or carelessness, had to make full restitution for the loss. By contrast, many other societies in both ancient and modern times have decreed prison time and even death for crimes against property.


## #20: What was the purpose of the Mosaic covenant?
**What was the purpose of the Mosaic covenant?** Israel was already God’s chosen people because of the promises God made to Abraham. The covenant with Moses established the nation as a holy kingdom of priests, dedicated to serving God and teaching the other nations of the world about him ([19:5–6](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+19%3A5%E2%80%936/)). Israel was a theocracy, a nation ruled directly by God. The Mosaic covenant established the political, social, and religious aspects of Israel’s life.


## #21: The table for the bread of the Presence
**The table for the bread of the Presence** held the 12 loaves of sacred bread which were baked the day before the Sabbath. On the Sabbath, the priests would eat the bread from the week before and replace it with the newly baked bread. This bread symbolized Israel’s dependence on God.


## #22: The bronze altar
**The bronze altar** was the largest item in the tabernacle courtyard, measuring more than seven feet square. Bronze was more resistant than other metals to the heat required for burnt offerings. The altar provided a contrast to the items inside the tabernacle tent, which were overlaid with gold.


## #23: Gold bells
The **gold bells** along the hems of the high priest’s garment ([28:33](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+28%3A33/)) served two purposes. They alerted people that the high priest was present, and they reminded the priest himself to be reverent and careful in carrying out his sacred duties. 


## #24: Veil
A **veil** separated the altar from the Most Holy Place of God’s presence in the tabernacle and later in the temple. Aaron the priest was to make atonement there once a year on behalf of the people and their sin (ch. [29](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+29%3A1%E2%80%9346/)). The tearing of the veil at Christ’s death indicated that the Mosaic institution of sacrifices and rituals had now been replaced by the final sacrifice of Christ. Jesus Christ’s sacrifice was enough "once for all" to sanctify eternally all who trusted in him (see [Heb. 9:11–12; 10:1–18](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+9%3A11%E2%80%9312%2C+10%3A1%E2%80%9318/)).


## #25: Altar of incense
**Altar of incense.** Incense was burned to purify the altars after animals had been slaughtered there. Incense also symbolized Israel’s constant prayer to God.


## #26: Instructions for the tabernacle
The level of detail given in God’s **instructions for the tabernacle** in ch. [30](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+30%3A1%E2%80%9338/) emphasizes that Israel is to worship the Lord in their midst according to his word and plan.


## #27: The Jewish year
**The Jewish year** was based on the annual rotation of the sun, moon, and stars, and on the cycle for planting and harvesting crops. The OT refers to days, months, years, and seasons, but no passages specify a complete calendar.


## #28: Acacia wood
**Acacia wood** was highly valued for its beauty and durability. Around the Mediterranean, some acacias are like shrubs, while others grow up to 50 feet (15 m) tall. They are one of the few large trees hardy enough to withstand the harsh desert climate. They are also resistant to insects, which find the taste of the wood unpleasant.


## #29: Cubits
**Cubits** were a basic unit of measurement in Israel. One cubit equaled the distance from the elbow to the fingertips—about 18 inches (46 cm).


## #30: Furniture
Every piece of **furniture** in the tabernacle was crafted according to God’s plan. Each item represented something about God’s character: his sovereignty, his generosity, his presence with his people. They were reminders of how God met their needs and forgave their sins.


## #31: Linen
**Linen** was made from the flax plant. The plants were pulled up by their roots and dried before undergoing a process known as "retting," which loosened the fibers. The fibers were then beaten and combed so that they could be spun into thread. The result was a fabric that was light, durable, and easy to bleach. It was ideal for the hot, dry climate of ancient Israel.


## #32: God’s glory fills the tabernacle
Israel has witnessed some incredible events, such as the 10 plagues and the parting of the Sea. Now, at the end of [Exodus](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+1%3A1%E2%80%9340%3A38/), **God’s glory fills the tabernacle** and he will lead them to the Promised Land.
