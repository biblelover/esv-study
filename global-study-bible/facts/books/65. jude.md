# Jude Facts

## #1: Michael
**Michael** (v. [9](https://www.esv.org/Jude+9/)) is the only archangel identified by name in Scripture. In the book of [Daniel](https://www.esv.org/Daniel+1%3A1%E2%80%9312%3A13/), he is the guardian of God’s people ([Dan. 10:13, 21; 12:1](https://www.esv.org/Daniel+10%3A13%2C+10%3A21%2C+12%3A1/)). He also leads the heavenly army in the fight against the dragon in [Rev. 12:7](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+12%3A7/).


## #2: While Christians wait for the Lord to return,
**While Christians wait for the Lord to return,** they should be building themselves up in the faith, praying, and showing mercy to doubters and sinners—while also fearing the evil influence of such people (vv. [20–23](https://www.esv.org/Jude+9/)).
