# James Facts

## #1: Mirrors
Up until the first century a.d., **mirrors** in the Near East were made of polished bronze or other metals. With the invention of glass in Lebanon, new techniques could be used to create more reflective surfaces. James compares God’s Word to a mirror in which people can see themselves in the light of God’s truth ([1:22–25](https://www.esv.org/James+1%3A22%E2%80%9325/)).


## #2: Rahab
**Rahab** is a remarkable example of the fact that God can use whomever he chooses to accomplish his will ([1 Cor. 1:26–31](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+1%3A26%E2%80%9331/)). Though a prostitute and a Gentile, Rahab is listed in the genealogy of Jesus ([Matt. 1:5](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+1%3A5/)). She is remembered as a model of faith completed in works ([James 2:25](https://www.esv.org/James+2%3A25/)) and is listed among the heroes of faith in [Hebrews 11](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+11%3A1%E2%80%9340/).


## #3: Familiar word pictures
**Familiar word pictures.** The images James uses to describe the power of the tongue ([3:1–12](https://www.esv.org/James+3%3A1%E2%80%9312/)) were well chosen to communicate to his original readers. The Greek playwright Sophocles spoke of wild horses being tamed by a small bit in the mouth. The Jewish philosopher Philo compared one’s senses to a helmsman steering a boat. And the Roman historian Plutarch compared a loose tongue to a blazing forest fire.


## #4: What does it mean to submit?
**What does it mean to submit?** Submission means that one has willingly placed himself or herself under the authority of another. It means humility and obedience, rather than rebellion. Submission to God means that the believer has surrendered to God’s will and embraced the Lord’s rule in his or her life ([4:7](https://www.esv.org/James+4%3A7/)).


## #5: Two rainy seasons
There are **two rainy seasons** in Palestine ([5:7](https://www.esv.org/James+5%3A7/)). The “early rains” come during the fall. Rain during this time is crucial to farmers, because it helps seeds germinate. “Late rains” come in early spring and help the seedlings turn into mature plants.
