# 2-Kings Facts

## #1: Israel and Judah’s sins continue
**Israel and Judah’s sins continue.** Picking up where [1 Kings](https://www.esv.org/1+Kings+1%3A1%E2%80%9322%3A53/) left off, Israel and Judah continued to decline through false worship and disobedience. They were led into sin by their kings, most of whom failed to follow the Lord.


## #2: Bears
Though **bears** no longer live in the region of Palestine, the bear God used to punish the disrespectful boys ([2:24](https://www.esv.org/2+Kings+2%3A24/)) was probably of a type that could grow up to 7 feet (2 m) tall and reach 500 pounds (227 kg).


## #3: The Moabite Stone
**The Moabite Stone** is a small monument inscribed with details about the conflict between the Israelites and the Moabites ([3:4–27](https://www.esv.org/2+Kings+3%3A4%E2%80%9327/)). Written by the Moabites, it emphasizes their victories over Israel. More importantly, it features the earliest known reference to the Lord’s personal name (YHWH; see note on [Gen. 2:4](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+2%3A4/)) outside of the Bible.


## #4: Wild gourds
The **wild gourds** gathered by the prophet ([4:38–41](https://www.esv.org/2+Kings+4%3A38%E2%80%9341/)) were poisonous. The prophet, of course, did not realize this. He added the gourds to the stew, “not knowing what they were” ([4:39](https://www.esv.org/2+Kings+4%3A39/)).


## #5: Who was Rimmon?
**Who was Rimmon?** Rimmon was another name for the Syrian god Baal-hadad. Known as the storm god, he was depicted as a bearded deity holding a club and thunderbolt. He was considered the most powerful god in the Syrian religion.


## #6: What is a siege?
**What is a siege?** In ancient times, a “siege” occurred when an enemy army surrounded a city and de­­manded that it surrender. If the city refused, the invaders cut off food and water supplies and attempted to tear down the city’s defensive walls. Cities usually surrendered when they ran out of water. Those who fought to the end faced terrible consequences when their enemies finally overwhelmed them ([6:24–7:20; 17:5; 25:1–2](https://www.esv.org/2+Kings+6%3A24%E2%80%937%3A20%2C+17%3A5%2C+25%3A1%E2%80%932/)).


## #7: Seah
A **seah** is a dry measurement equal to about 7 quarts or 7.7 liters.


## #8: Was it Joram or Jehoram?
**Was it Joram or Jehoram?** At about the same time, Israel had a king named Joram who was sometimes called Jehoram, while Judah had a king named Jehoram who was sometimes called Joram. King Joram of Israel was a son of Ahab while King Jehoram of Judah married a daughter of Ahab.


## #9: Anointed with oil
Kings, priests, and prophets were sometimes **anointed with oil** as a sign that God had set them apart for a special purpose (see [1 Sam. 15:1](https://www.esv.org/1+Samuel+15%3A1/); [Lev. 8:30](https://www.esv.org/Leviticus+8%3A30/)). More commonly, oil was used in cooking and to clean and moisturize the body (see [Deut. 28:40](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+28%3A40/); [2 Sam. 14:2](https://www.esv.org/2+Samuel+14%3A2/)).


## #10: Eunuchs
**Eunuchs** had many roles in the ancient world. They served in the royal court as cooks, scribes, guards of the harem, and ambassadors. The Hebrew word for “eunuch” usually refers to a castrated man, though it does not always do so (see [Gen. 39:1](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+39%3A1/)).


## #11: Jehu pays tribute
**Jehu pays tribute.** Archaeologists have found a stone carving that shows King Jehu of Israel paying tribute to Shalmaneser III, king of Assyria. Known as the Black Obelisk, it depicts Jehu bowing to the ground in front of Shalmaneser.


## #12: Joash
**Joash** (or Jehoash) became King of Judah at the age of seven. Joash listened to the godly instruction of Jehoiada the priest and obeyed the Lord. But after Jehoiada died, Joash took advice from idolaters and forgot the Lord.


## #13: Hazael
**Hazael** ([12:17](https://www.esv.org/2+Kings+12%3A17/)) was king of Syria from 843–796 b.c. He threatened Israel during the reigns of Jehu ([1 Kings 19:17](https://www.esv.org/1+Kings+19%3A17/)), Joram ([8:28](https://www.esv.org/2+Kings+8%3A28/)), and Jehoahaz ([13:22](https://www.esv.org/2+Kings+13%3A22/)).


## #14: Elath
**Elath** ([14:22](https://www.esv.org/2+Kings+14%3A22/)) was a strategic seaport on the northernmost tip of the Red Sea. It was located at the southern end of the King’s Highway, which ran north all the way to Damascus.


## #15: Menahem’s tax receipts?
**Menahem’s tax receipts?** Archaeologists working at the site of Samaria have discovered 63 shards of pottery, dating to about the time of King Menahem, on which tax payments are noted. These may be a record of the additional tax payments Menahem imposed on Israel to pay off the Assyrian king ([15:19–20](https://www.esv.org/2+Kings+15%3A19%E2%80%9320/)).


## #16: Why were the Israelites deported?
**Why were the Israelites deported?** The Babylonians had learned that destroying an enemy’s land but allowing them to remain in it was a bad idea. It ruined potential crop resources and gave an opportunity for the conquered people to regroup and rebel. Instead, they deported the conquered people to other lands, and brought in people from other places to live in the conquered territory. This mixing of ethnic groups made any organized rebellion less likely.


## #17: “Please speak in Aramaic.”
**“Please speak in Aramaic.”** As Assyria tried to conquer Judah, they sent a delegation to Jerusalem to engage in “psychological warfare” ([18:17–37](https://www.esv.org/2+Kings+18%3A17%E2%80%9337/)). They made public proclamations intended to turn the Judeans against their king. The Judean officials begged the Assyrians to speak only in Aramaic (v. [26](https://www.esv.org/2+Kings+18%3A26/)), which these officials would have understood but which the ordinary bystanders did not understand. But the Assyrians went on speaking in Hebrew, seeking to demoralize all those who were listening.


## #18: Siege mounds
**Siege mounds** were mounds or ramps built out of dirt, rubble, and timbers. They were designed so that soldiers could batter down a city’s walls and fortifications. The Assyrians were the first to use wheeled towers with these mounds. Protected inside the tower as it was moved up the ramp to the wall, the soldiers could then exit the tower and invade the city. A siege mound can still be found today at Masada.


## #19: Hezekiah’s tunnel
**Hezekiah’s tunnel.** As Assyria prepared to attack Jerusalem, the city faced a crisis, since its water supply was outside the city walls. King Hezekiah responded by ordering the construction of a tunnel from the water source to the Pool of Siloam, within the city walls ([20:20](https://www.esv.org/2+Kings+20%3A20/)).


## #20: Why did Josiah tear his clothes when the Law was read?
**Why did Josiah tear his clothes when the Law was read?** As the Book of the Law was read in public for the first time in nearly 60 years, King Josiah tore his clothes as a sign of his grief. He grieved when he realized that he, as the nation’s leader, had not been fulfilling the commandments of the Lord.


## #21: The host of heaven
**The host of heaven** refers in [23:4](https://www.esv.org/2+Kings+23%3A4/) to false gods, represented by celestial bodies such as the sun, moon, and planets. King Josiah ordered the destruction of all these symbols of pagan worship.


## #22: Josiah’s reforms
**Josiah’s reforms** reveal the true extent of Judah’s idolatry ([23:1–27](https://www.esv.org/2+Kings+23%3A1%E2%80%9327/)). Despite God’s commands to worship him alone, his people adopted Canaanite gods, including Baal, Asherah, and Molech. They also worshiped the stars and small household idols.


## #23: What happened to the ark of the covenant?
**What happened to the ark of the covenant?** After the fall of Jerusalem, the ark completely disappeared from historical records. It is unlikely that the Babylonians took it because there is no mention of it in Babylonian records.
