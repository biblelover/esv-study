# 2-Thessalonians Facts

## #1: Why were Christians being persecuted?
**Why were Christians being persecuted?** The fact that Christians worshiped only one God excluded them from participation in community gatherings, which often focused on other gods. The church’s custom of meeting secretly also raised suspicions of disloyalty to the Roman Empire.


## #2: Sanctification
**Sanctification** ([2:13](https://www.esv.org/2+Thessalonians+2%3A13/)) refers to the transforming work of the Holy Spirit in a believer’s life, whereby the person becomes increasingly more like Christ. This ongoing process continues until the redeemed person is resurrected and made completely holy in heaven (glorification).


## #3: Tough love
**Tough love.** In contrast to the warm and joyful tone of [1 Thessalonians](https://www.esv.org/1+Thessalonians+1%3A1%E2%80%935%3A28/), [2 Thessalonians](https://www.esv.org/2+Thessalonians+1%3A1%E2%80%933%3A18/) includes some blunt commands as Paul addresses bad behavior and bad thinking within the church. Some, for instance, were refusing to work for a living ([3:6–15](https://www.esv.org/2+Thessalonians+3%3A6%E2%80%9315/)).
