# 1-Timothy Facts

## #1: First letter to Timothy
After Paul established the church in Ephesus, Paul’s younger coworker Timothy stayed there to strengthen it against false teaching ([1:3](https://www.esv.org/1+Timothy+1%3A3/)). Paul’s **first letter to Timothy** provides further instruction about specific issues that the young church faced.


## #2: Hairstyles
**Hairstyles.** In Paul’s day, upper-class women showcased their wealth by braiding their hair elaborately and wearing expensive jewelry and clothing. Paul tells believing women to dress modestly and respectably. Godliness is more beautiful than external decoration ([2:9–10](https://www.esv.org/1+Timothy+2%3A9%E2%80%9310/); see [1 Peter 3:3–4](https://www.esv.org/1+Peter+3%3A3%E2%80%934/)).


## #3: The household of God
Paul often describes the church as **the household of God** ([3:4–5, 12, 15](https://www.esv.org/1+Timothy+3%3A4%E2%80%935%2C+3%3A12%2C+3%3A15/); see [Gal. 6:10](https://www.esv.org/Galatians+6%3A10/); [Eph. 2:19](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+2%3A19/)). This means that the church is God’s family, and its members are brothers and sisters. Also, just like a family, there are certain roles and responsibilities for its members.


## #4: Hospitality
**Hospitality** was encouraged within the early church ([5:10](https://www.esv.org/1+Timothy+5%3A10/)). Peter teaches Christians to “show hospitality to one another without grumbling” ([1 Pet. 4:9](https://www.esv.org/1+Peter+4%3A9/); see [Rom. 12:13](https://www.esv.org/Romans+12%3A13/)) The writer of [Hebrews](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+1%3A1%E2%80%9313%3A25/) even comments that some who offered hospitality actually “entertained angels” without realizing it ([Heb. 13:2](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+13%3A2/)).
