# Ecclesiastes Facts

## #1: Ecclesiastes
**[Ecclesiastes](https://www.esv.org/Ecclesiastes+1%3A1%E2%80%9312%3A14/)** encourages God’s people to trust him in a fallen and often confusing world, in which sin and heartache touch every corner of the globe. We are to “fear God and keep his commandments” ([12:13](https://www.esv.org/Ecclesiastes+12%3A13/)), even when we cannot understand everything that is going on around us.


## #2: Vanity, vanities, and vain
The words **vanity, vanities, and vain** occur nearly 40 times in [Ecclesiastes](https://www.esv.org/Ecclesiastes+1%3A1%E2%80%9312%3A14/). Their literal meaning is “vapor” or “breath,” so they are used to describe things that can be fleeting or elusive, like the search for meaning and purpose in life.


## #3: Working too hard?
**Working too hard?** It is equally wrong to be lazy or to be a “workaholic.” People sometimes work too hard because they want all the nice things their neighbors have ([4:4](https://www.esv.org/Ecclesiastes+4%3A4/)). People should work diligently but should also enjoy the quiet contentment that comes from serving the Lord (v. [6](https://www.esv.org/Ecclesiastes+4%3A6/)).


## #4: The peaceful shadows of old age
**The peaceful shadows of old age.** The righteous will enjoy a long and peaceful old age, like the shadows of evening ([8:13](https://www.esv.org/Ecclesiastes+8%3A13/)). There is no such hope, however, for the wicked.


## #5: “Eat, drink, and be merry”?
**“Eat, drink, and be merry”?** [Ecclesiastes](https://www.esv.org/Ecclesiastes+1%3A1%E2%80%9312%3A14/) advises those who serve God to enjoy his gifts of food, drink, comfort, married life, and honest work ([9:7–9](https://www.esv.org/Ecclesiastes+9%3A7%E2%80%939/); compare [2:24–26; 3:13; 5:19–20](https://www.esv.org/Ecclesiastes+2%3A24%E2%80%9326%2C+3%3A13%2C+5%3A19%E2%80%9320/)).
