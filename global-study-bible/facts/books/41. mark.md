# Mark Facts

## #1: What is a “Gospel”?
**What is a “Gospel”?** “Gospel” literally means “good news.” The “Gospel according to Mark,” along with the other three Gospels, reports the good news of salvation through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. This salvation is freely available to everyone who believes in Jesus Christ, everywhere in the world.


## #2: Reclining at the table
**Reclining at the table.** During formal dinners in NT times, guests reclined on a couch that stretched around three sides of a room ([2:15](https://www.esv.org/Mark+2%3A15/)). The host took the central place surrounded by a U-shaped series of tables. The most honored guests reclined on either side of the host, with the guests’ heads toward the tables and their feet toward the wall.


## #3: Why does Mark say “immediately” so often?
**Why does Mark say “immediately” so often?** The Greek word translated “immediately” occurs in the Gospel of Mark more often than in the rest of the NT combined. The frequent use of the word stresses the importance of an event and helps to show that Christ’s ministry has a divine purpose and plan behind it.


## #4: What did people use for lamp fuel?
**What did people use for lamp fuel?** In OT times, people used animal fat as fuel for their lamps. By NT times, this had been replaced with olive oil. Olives were usually pressed two or three times. Oil from the first pressing was used for food. Oil from the second and third pressing was used as fuel for lamps.


## #5: The one true God
**The one true God.** Mark emphasizes the divine Sonship of Jesus. In NT times the Roman emperor was worshiped by many as a god or as a “son of god.” It was essential, then, for Mark to make it clear that Jesus was the Son of the one true God. Jesus is not a tribal deity only for Jews, but is to be received by all peoples and cultures as Lord of all.


## #6: Shake the dust from your feet
**Shake the dust from your feet.** In ancient times, when Jews returned from a Gentile area, they would sometimes shake the dust off their feet ([6:11](https://www.esv.org/Mark+6%3A11/)) to avoid contamination from Gentiles. The act of shaking off the dust illustrates that people who reject God’s message are accountable to God alone.


## #7: What is “Corban”?
**What is “Corban”?** Corban ([7:11](https://www.esv.org/Mark+7%3A11/)) literally means “dedicated to God.” Jewish tradition said that money set aside for the care of one’s parents could be given to the temple instead. Jesus said that this tradition allowed people to avoid honoring their parents as the law required.


## #8: A diet of bread
**A diet of bread.** For many of the poorer people in NT times, as well as for many around the world today, bread might be their entire meal. Jesus called himself the “bread of life.”


## #9: A voice from the cloud?
**A voice from the cloud?** In the Bible, clouds are often associated with the presence of God and the mystery and holiness surrounding him ([9:7](https://www.esv.org/Mark+9%3A7/)). The prophet Nahum said, “clouds are the dust of his feet” ([Nah. 1:3](https://www.esv.org/Nahum+1%3A3/)).


## #10: Blindness
**Blindness** was a common condition in biblical times. Because they were unable to work, people who were blind often became beggars ([10:46–52](https://www.esv.org/Mark+10%3A46%E2%80%9352/); see [Luke 18:35](https://www.esv.org/Luke+18%3A35/)).


## #11: Fig trees
**Fig trees** ([11:13](https://www.esv.org/Mark+11%3A13/)) reach an average height of around 10 to 30 feet (3 to 9 m). Figs are harvested twice a year, once in spring or early summer and again in autumn. Figs could be eaten straight from the tree, dried, or made into cakes for the winter.


## #12: The Sadducees
**The Sadducees** were a small but powerful group of Jewish leaders who did not believe in the resurrection ([12:18](https://www.esv.org/Mark+12%3A18/)). This may have been because of their emphasis on the Pentateuch ([Genesis](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+1%3A1%E2%80%9350%3A26/)–[Deuteronomy](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+1%3A1%E2%80%9334%3A12/)), which does not seem to explicitly mention the resurrection. But Jesus showed them that the idea of resurrection can, in fact, be found in the Pentateuch ([Mark 12:26–27](https://www.esv.org/Mark+12%3A26%E2%80%9327/)).


## #13: The Mount of Olives
**The Mount of Olives** ([13:3](https://www.esv.org/Mark+13%3A3/)) gets its name from the olive trees that grow there in abundance. Olive trees were highly valued in Israel as a source of oil and wood. Gethsemane, which was on the Mount of Olives, means “oil press.”


## #14: Rabbi
**Rabbi** ([14:45](https://www.esv.org/Mark+14%3A45/)) literally means “my lord.” The title was used to address outstanding teachers of the Jewish law. Jesus told the disciples that they were not to be called rabbi, because they, like all believers in Christ everywhere in the world, have one true teacher—the Lord Jesus himself ([Matt. 23:8](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+23%3A8/)).


## #15: Releasing prisoners
**Releasing prisoners** ([15:6](https://www.esv.org/Mark+15%3A6/)) was apparently a custom the Roman governor Pilate had instituted as a means of winning favor with the Jewish people. Ironically, in this case, he ended up releasing a man convicted of rebelling against Rome.


## #16: Scourging
**Scourging** is another term for flogging, a cruel punishment used by the Romans ([15:15](https://www.esv.org/Mark+15%3A15/)). Prisoners were tied to a post and beaten with a leather whip that had pieces of bone and metal attached to it. In many cases, scourging was fatal.
