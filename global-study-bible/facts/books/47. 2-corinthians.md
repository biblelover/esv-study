# 2-Corinthians Facts

## #1: Amen
**Amen** is the Greek form of the Hebrew word mean­ing “to confirm.” The word is used throughout the Bible to affirm the truth of important statements (see [1:20](https://www.esv.org/2+Corinthians+1%3A20/)). Paul often ends his letters with “Amen” (see [Rom. 16:27](https://www.esv.org/Romans+16%3A27/)), but here in [2 Corinthians](https://www.esv.org/2+Corinthians+1%3A1%E2%80%9313%3A14/) he says it near the beginning of his letter.


## #2: A new covenant
**A new covenant.** God wrote the first covenant, the law, on stone tablets ([Ex. 24:12](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+24%3A12/)). The new covenant is “written” on hearts ([2 Cor. 3:2–3](https://www.esv.org/2+Corinthians+3%3A2%E2%80%933/); see [Jer. 31:31–34](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+31%3A31%E2%80%9334/); [Ezek. 11:19](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+11%3A19/)). In other words, the Spirit changes believers’ hearts to enable them to obey God.


## #3: Treasure in jars of clay
**Treasure in jars of clay** ([4:7](https://www.esv.org/2+Corinthians+4%3A7/)). Paul used this word picture to contrast believers’ knowledge of the gospel (“treasure”) with the hardships and weaknesses believers experience daily (see [Ps. 30:12](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+30%3A12/); [Isa. 30:14](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+30%3A14/)).


## #4: What does it mean to be “reconciled”?
**What does it mean to be “reconciled”?** To be reconciled means to be reunited with someone from whom one has been alienated. Forgiveness can lead to restored fellowship. Sin leads to alienation from God, but through Christ we can be forgiven and reconciled to God. “Be reconciled to God” ([5:20](https://www.esv.org/2+Corinthians+5%3A20/)) is thus a wonderful invitation to the gospel (see also [Rom. 5:11](https://www.esv.org/Romans+5%3A11/)).


## #5: Titus
**Titus** ([7:6](https://www.esv.org/2+Corinthians+7%3A6/)) was Paul’s coworker ([8:23](https://www.esv.org/2+Corinthians+8%3A23/)). He had the unenviable task of delivering a severe letter from Paul to the Corinthians. Thankfully, the majority of the Corinthians repented of the sins that had prompted Paul’s letter ([7:7](https://www.esv.org/2+Corinthians+7%3A7/)). Paul later wrote to Titus in Crete, where he was establishing churches.


## #6: Doing your fair share
**Doing your fair share.** In chs. [8–9](https://www.esv.org/2+Corinthians+8%3A1%E2%80%939%3A15/), Paul asked the Corinthians to contribute money to his collection for poor Christians in Jerusalem. Paul did not expect them to give so much that they would be “burdened”; he only asked that they do their fair share ([8:13–14](https://www.esv.org/2+Corinthians+8%3A13%E2%80%9314/)).


## #7: More than simple charity
**More than simple charity.** From the Jerusalem church, the good news about Christ had spread to the Gentile world. Paul’s collection (chs. [8–9](https://www.esv.org/2+Corinthians+8%3A1%E2%80%939%3A15/)) was an opportunity for Gentile believers to show gratitude to their Jewish brothers and sisters in Christ (see [Rom. 15:27](https://www.esv.org/Romans+15%3A27/)).


## #8: Problems in Corinth
**Problems in Corinth.** Paul’s second visit to Corinth was a painful one. The Corinthians had accepted false teachers, and they openly rebelled against Paul and the gospel. Grieved, he left and sent them a severe letter (now lost). Paul now warns them that during his third visit he will be forced to judge those who have not repented from their sins ([10:2; 12:20–21; 13:10](https://www.esv.org/2+Corinthians+10%3A2%2C+12%3A20%E2%80%9321%2C+13%3A10/)).


## #9: Preaching for free
**Preaching for free.** Some traveling teachers in Paul’s day accepted money from their listeners, but Paul worked as a tentmaker to support himself ([Acts 18:3](https://www.esv.org/Acts+18%3A3/); see [1 Cor. 9:4–18](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+9%3A4%E2%80%9318/)). Churches also supported his missions financially ([2 Cor. 11:9](https://www.esv.org/2+Corinthians+11%3A9/)).
