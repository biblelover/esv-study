# Micah Facts

## #1: Moresheth,
**Moresheth,** where Micah lived, was a small village 22 miles (35 km) southwest of Jerusalem. It was one of the many military outposts set up to secure the kingdom’s borders.


## #2: List of disasters
Micah’s **list of disasters** ([1:10–15](https://www.esv.org/Micah+1%3A10%E2%80%9315/)) is based on a series of word plays. For example, the city name Beth-le-aphrah means “House of Dust,” and its inhabitants will mourn “in the dust” ([1:10](https://www.esv.org/Micah+1%3A10/)). Lachish sounds like “steeds,” and they will flee on their steeds ([1:13](https://www.esv.org/Micah+1%3A13/)).


## #3: The business of prophecy
**The business of prophecy.** The life of a prophet was not an easy one, and few could carry out its rigorous demands. False prophets, however, could do very well for themselves because they charged money for their prophecies. Not surprisingly, these “paid prophecies” usually favored the person paying for them ([3:5](https://www.esv.org/Micah+3%3A5/)).


## #4: The land of Nimrod
**The land of Nimrod** ([5:6](https://www.esv.org/Micah+5%3A6/)) included Assyria and other parts of Mesopotamia. Nimrod was the son of Cush and was a “mighty hunter before the Lord” ([Gen. 10:8–14](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+10%3A8%E2%80%9314/)). Many cities of the region claim him as their founder.


## #5: God has always been the same
**God has always been the same.** The last verses of Micah describe God the Father as forgiving, compassionate, faithful, and loving ([7:18–20](https://www.esv.org/Micah+7%3A18%E2%80%9320/)). Jesus Christ, who is God the Son, is the living embodiment of these characteristics.
