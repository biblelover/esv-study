# Hebrews Facts

## #1: Who wrote Hebrews?
**Who wrote [Hebrews](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+1%3A1%E2%80%9313%3A25/)?** The author and the audience of [Hebrews](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+1%3A1%E2%80%9313%3A25/) are both unknown. However, we do know that Timothy was a friend of the author ([13:23](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+13%3A23/)), that the author was probably not an eyewitness of Jesus ([2:1, 3](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+2%3A1%2C+2%3A3/)), and that Jewish Christians are the most likely recipients.


## #2: Jesus the master builder
**Jesus the master builder.** In the era of peace made possible by Roman rule, the building of public buildings and private homes flourished. Working primarily with materials such as marble, bronze, and terra-cotta, architects designed and built large, beautiful structures throughout the empire. However, such buildings were nothing compared to the individual new lives being “built” by Jesus the master builder ([3:3–6](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+3%3A3%E2%80%936/)).


## #3: Throne
Approaching a human ruler’s **throne** with a request can be dangerous, especially when one is fully at the mercy of the ruler. In contrast, Christians can expect to find mercy and help when they approach God’s throne with a request ([4:16](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+4%3A16/)).


## #4: Anchor
The safety of sailors depended greatly on a ship’s **anchor**. Without it, the likelihood of shipwreck in­­creased dramatically. The anchor therefore became an important emblem of hope and stability for early Christians ([6:19](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+6%3A19/)).


## #5: A better covenant
**A better covenant.** A key theme in the book of [Hebrews](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+1%3A1%E2%80%9313%3A25/) is the superiority of the new covenant over the old. The words “better,” “more,” or “greater” to describe the new covenant appear a combined total of 25 times.


## #6: Why didn’t the old covenant last?
**Why didn’t the old covenant last?** A covenant is an agreement between two parties. The Israelites did not keep their part of the covenant. That is why the first covenant did not work ([8:7–9](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+8%3A7%E2%80%939/)). But God mercifully initiated a new covenant through Christ. This covenant offers many more blessings, including the Holy Spirit’s ministry of helping believers obey God ([8:10–11](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+8%3A10%E2%80%9311/)).


## #7: The mercy seat
**The mercy seat** ([9:5](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+9%3A5/)) was the place where the high priest sprinkled blood once a year to atone for the people’s sins ([Lev. 16:14](https://www.esv.org/Leviticus+16%3A14/); see [Ex. 25:22](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+25%3A22/)). In contrast, Jesus’ death redeemed our sins “once for all” ([Heb. 9:12](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+9%3A12/)). His sacrificial death also gives us the freedom to serve God ([9:14](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+9%3A14/)).


## #8: Eagerly awaiting
There is good reason for believers around the world to be **eagerly awaiting** Jesus’ second coming. But unbelievers can only fear, for they will face final judgment for their sin ([9:27–28](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+9%3A27%E2%80%9328/)).


## #9: Jesus’ perfect sacrifice for sin
**Jesus’ perfect sacrifice for sin.** Animal sacrifices symbolized payment for sins under the first covenant ([10:1](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+10%3A1/)). But Jesus’ death paid for sins in a way that animal sacrifices could not ([10:1–18](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+10%3A1%E2%80%9318/)). It also made sanctification, the process of conforming into the image of Christ, possible for believers ([10:14](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+10%3A14/)).


## #10: Faith
Even under the old covenant, **faith** was essential for a relationship with God. The OT saints believed God and obeyed him even though they did not see his promises fulfilled completely (ch. [11](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+11%3A1%E2%80%9340/)). Christians, however, have the amazing privilege of having seen God’s plan fulfilled in Christ.


## #11: Foot races
**Foot races** were a popular sport in the Greco-Roman world. Paul uses the image of a race to illustrate the Christian life ([1 Cor. 9:24](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+9%3A24/); [2 Tim. 4:7](https://www.esv.org/2+Timothy+4%3A7/)). The writer of [Hebrews](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+1%3A1%E2%80%9313%3A25/) also encourages believers to “run with endurance the race that is set before us” ([Heb. 12:1](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+12%3A1/)).


## #12: Roman imprisonment
**Roman imprisonment** varied greatly, depending on the crime. Some prisoners were held in public prisons while others were kept under house arrest. The writer of [Hebrews](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+1%3A1%E2%80%9313%3A25/) reminds his audience to “remember those who are in prison” ([13:3](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+13%3A3/)). This included believers imprisoned for their faith ([13:23; 10:32–34](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+13%3A23%2C+10%3A32%E2%80%9334/)).
