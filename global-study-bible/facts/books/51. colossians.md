# Colossians Facts

## #1: Colossae
**Colossae** was most likely the smallest city to receive a letter from Paul. Located along the Lycus River about a hundred miles (161 km) east of Ephesus, it was known for its wool production.


## #2: Worship of angels
**Worship of angels.** Many [Colossians](https://www.esv.org/Colossians+1%3A1%E2%80%934%3A18/) greatly feared evil spirits. In order to control the spirits and to avoid affliction, they called on angels for help and protection ([2:18](https://www.esv.org/Colossians+2%3A18/)). Paul reminds them of Christ’s supremacy in dealing with demonic powers ([1:13–14; 2:15](https://www.esv.org/Colossians+1%3A13%E2%80%9314%2C+2%3A15/))


## #3: Scythians
The **Scythians** ([3:11](https://www.esv.org/Colossians+3%3A11/)) lived about 500 miles (805 km) north of Colossae along the Black Sea coast. The Greeks thought of them as violent, uneducated, uncivilized people. In contrast, Paul states that Christ binds all people from all nations together in unity through his love. Racial and cultural prejudice has no place among Christians.


## #4: Letter to Laodicea
Paul’s **letter to Laodicea** was probably lost, though some think it could be the same letter as [Ephesians](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+1%3A1%E2%80%936%3A24/). Regardless, Paul expected that his letter to the Colos­sians would also be read aloud to the Laodiceans ([4:15–16](https://www.esv.org/Colossians+4%3A15%E2%80%9316/)). Laodicea and Colossae were about 9 miles (14.5 km) apart (see also [Rev. 1:11; 3:14](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+1%3A11%2C+3%3A14/)).
