# Isaiah Facts

## #1: The Holy One of Israel
**The Holy One of Israel** is Isaiah’s main title for God. The phrase occurs 25 times in the book, but rarely elsewhere in the Bible. The word “holy” describes the Lord’s absolute moral purity and his being far greater than all that he has created.


## #2: Pruning hooks
**Pruning hooks** ([2:4](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+2%3A4/)) were used to cut away newly formed leaves and shoots from grape vines. The blade curved into a sharp hook at the tip, allowing it to capture and cut new growth more easily than a straight blade.


## #3:  tinkling of feet
The** tinkling of feet** mentioned in [3:16](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+3%3A16/) is probably the ankle bracelets many women wore in the ancient world. They were usually made of bronze and were attached permanently.


## #4: Ten acres of vineyard
**Ten acres of vineyard** would normally produce 10,000 gallons (37,850 liters) of wine yearly. Isaiah says that the Lord’s judgment upon Israel would be so severe that ten acres of vineyard would produce only one bath, or six gallons (23 liters). See [5:10](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+5%3A10/).


## #5: Shaving
**Shaving.** Being forced to shave was a mark of humiliation ([7:20](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+7%3A20/)). In some nations of that time, the hair of slaves was shaved in a particular way to identify them as their owner’s property.


## #6: A sanctuary and a rock?
**A sanctuary and a rock?** Elsewhere in Scripture, the Lord is described as a “rock” that provides a place of “sanctuary” or “refuge” (see [Ps. 61:2–3](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+61%3A2%E2%80%933/)). Here, however, he is a “sanctuary” for his people but a “rock” over which his enemies will stumble ([Isa. 8:14](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+8%3A14/); compare [Rom. 9:33](https://www.esv.org/Romans+9%3A33/)).


## #7: Yokes
**Yokes** were wooden frames placed on work animals such as oxen to harness their power. When Israelites heard prophets like Isaiah speak of the yokes placed on them by their oppressors ([10:27](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+10%3A27/)), they would readily understand what he meant.


## #8: Farm animals
The idea of tame **farm animals** living in harmony with **wild animals** such as lions and bears ([11:6–9](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+11%3A6%E2%80%939/)) would have been a startling thought for the people of Isaiah’s day, for whom such predators were a frequent threat (see also [65:17–25](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+65%3A17%E2%80%9325/)).


## #9: Joyful trees
**Joyful trees.** For many centuries, the “cedars of Lebanon” were hauled away by powerful empires like Assyria and Babylon. When Babylon is defeated, those trees will rejoice that “no woodcutter comes up against us” ([14:8](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+14%3A8/)).


## #10: Payment in lambs
**Payment in lambs.** The people of Moab offered to pay the Israelites to protect them from their enemies. Such tribute was often paid in goods rather than with money; since the Moabites had many sheep, that’s how they paid ([16:1](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+16%3A1/)).


## #11: Olive harvesting
**Olive harvesting** was very similar to grain harvesting. The olive harvesters would beat the branches of the tree with long poles, knocking the olives to the ground. The uppermost branches were left untouched so that the poor could gather what remained ([17:6](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+17%3A6/)).


## #12: Competing Pharaohs
**Competing Pharaohs.** Beginning in about 1000 b.c., Egypt fell into a period of decline and royal feuding that lasted nearly 400 years. During Isaiah’s time, there were four rival pharaohs claiming the Egyptian throne.


## #13: Key to the house of David
The **key to the house of David** was carried by the steward, and it opened every door and gate in the palace. It was probably bronze and was large enough that it had to be worn around the neck (“on his shoulder,” [22:22](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+22%3A22/)). For the steward, it was a status symbol.


## #14: Cyprus
**Cyprus** ([23:1](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+23%3A1/)) is the third largest island in the Mediterranean Sea. Seafarers like the people of Sidon ([23:12](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+23%3A12/)) would have valued it as both a seaport and a place of refuge.


## #15: Chalkstone
**Chalkstone** is a type of limestone that, when crushed, can be used for things such as whitewashing and as mortar for brick-laying. Because it was so easy to crush, Isaiah used it as a visual example of how the Lord will destroy the altars and high places of idol worship ([27:9](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+27%3A9/)).


## #16: Details about farming
**Details about farming.** While a farmer “scatters” seeds like dill and cumin, other seeds, such as wheat and barley, had to be planted “in rows . . . in its proper place” ([28:25](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+28%3A25/)). The Bible is accurate and trustworthy, even in such agricultural details.


## #17: Yearly “round” of feasts
Hebrew schoolchildren were taught the **yearly “round” of feasts** ([29:1](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+29%3A1/)) at an early age. But the Lord is never impressed by insincere religious observances.


## #18: The sieve of destruction
**The sieve of destruction.** Farmers used two different kinds of sieves when working in the fields. The larger sieve was used to sift out big rocks and stones from the fields. A smaller one was used to sift out smaller particles from the grain being harvested. This smaller sieve is the one mentioned in [30:28](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+30%3A28/); the Lord is separating those who are his people (the grain) from those who are not.


## #19: Watchtowers
**Watchtowers** ([32:14](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+32%3A14/)) sometimes served as signal beacons when an invading force was approaching. By lighting small fires at the tops of the towers, watchmen could signal other towns that danger was near.


## #20: “He who counted”
**“He who counted”** ([33:18](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+33%3A18/)) refers to tax collectors. If people couldn’t pay their taxes, their property might be seized or they might become forced laborers. If the official failed to collect all the taxes due, he himself was punished.


## #21: To eat of your own vine and fig tree
**To eat of your own vine and fig tree** was a traditional blessing found in both the historical and prophetic books of Israel ([36:16](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+36%3A16/); [1 Kings 4:25](https://www.esv.org/1+Kings+4%3A25/)). It was a reward for trusting in the Lord. On the other hand, to lose those precious resources was a sign of God’s disfavor ([Jer. 5:17](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+5%3A17/)).


## #22: Cut off from the loom
**Cut off from the loom.** Weaving on a loom involves warp threads, which are attached to the top and bottom of the loom, and weft threads, which are woven through the warp. When the weaver finishes a piece, he cuts the warp threads from the loom. When Hezekiah was ill, he felt as if he had been cut off from the loom of God’s presence ([38:12](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+38%3A12/)).


## #23: Highways
The **highways** of the ancient Near East were not paved like many modern highways around the world today. Rather, they were maintained by the people living along the roads. They did their best to keep the roads level and free of obstacles (see [40:3](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+40%3A3/)).


## #24:  craftsmen and goldsmiths
The** craftsmen and goldsmiths** mentioned in [41:7](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+41%3A7/) were fashioning idols. The craftsman would begin by making a mold from an existing image. He would then cast the new image in metal. The goldsmith would then add gold plating, smooth it out with a hammer, and burnish it to give it a shine.


## #25: Long-term imprisonment
**Long-term imprisonment** was not as common in the ancient world as it is today. Prisons housed criminals awaiting trial. If there was no room in the jail, a pit or hole would be dug to hold the prisoner until his fate was decided ([42:22](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+42%3A22/)).


## #26: The prophecy about Cyrus
**The prophecy about Cyrus.** King Cyrus of Persia would one day make it possible for the Jews to return home from their exile in Babylon (see the book of [Ezra](https://www.esv.org/Ezra+1%3A1%E2%80%9310%3A44/)). Isaiah predicted this great event, even mentioning Cyrus by name ([Isa. 44:28; 45:1](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+44%3A28%2C+45%3A1/)), some 150 years before Cyrus’s time.


## #27: Feeding idols?
**Feeding idols?** In Isaiah’s day, people treated idols almost as if they were human. Some even fed, bathed, and dressed their idols. Isaiah spoke of how foolish it was for people to worship something that they themselves had made ([46:6](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+46%3A6/)).


## #28: Pass through the rivers
To **pass through the rivers** ([47:2](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+47%3A2/)) would have been humiliating for most people of Isaiah’s day. Since there were few bridges, people had to find shallow places, called fords, when crossing a river. It was the duty of slaves to carry their masters across.


## #29: A mouth like a sharp sword
**A mouth like a sharp sword.** The Bible often describes either the mouth or words coming from the mouth as a sword ([49:2](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+49%3A2/)). One Hebrew word for mouth actually means “edge,” as in “edge of a sword.” It is certainly an accurate picture of the power of words, for good or ill ([James 3:1–12](https://www.esv.org/James+3%3A1%E2%80%9312/)).


## #30: Head of the street
The **head of the street** ([51:20](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+51%3A20/)) referred to prominent corners or intersections within a city. Few cities were laid out according to a specific plan. Most had buildings scattered randomly, with narrow streets and dead-end alleys.


## #31: The feet of him who brings good news
In Isaiah’s time, **the feet of him who brings good news** referred to a messenger announcing a great deed, usually a military victory. Paul quotes [52:7](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+52%3A7/) in [Rom. 10:15](https://www.esv.org/Romans+10%3A15/), as he urges believers to spread the good news of salvation in Christ, freely available for all peoples around the globe. The word “gospel” means “good news.”


## #32: Enlarging the tent
**Enlarging the tent.** Tents were assembled from strips of goat hair about a yard wide. As the family grew, more strips of goat hair would be sewn onto the tent to make more room. Like an expanding tent, Israel would go from desolate exile to becoming increasingly great among the nations of the earth ([54:2](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+54%3A2/)).


## #33: Keeping the Sabbath
**Keeping the Sabbath** was an important expression of faith for Israelites ([56:2](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+56%3A2/)). All of life was organized around the weekly Sabbath. It also set them apart from the surrounding nations, none of whom kept the seventh day of the week as a holy day.


## #34: Finger-pointing
**Finger-pointing** ([58:9](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+58%3A9/)) was a very serious gesture that had several potentially negative meanings. It could be taken as an official accusation against someone or could mean that the person was the subject of gossip ([Prov. 6:12–13](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+6%3A12%E2%80%9313/)).


## #35: Ships of Tarshish
The phrase **ships of Tarshish** ([60:9](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+60%3A9/)) describes huge ships, able to go on voyages as long as three years ([1 Kings 10:22](https://www.esv.org/1+Kings+10%3A22/)). Isaiah says that ships like these will someday bring the nations to Israel to worship the Lord.


## #36: “The Spirit of the Lord God
**“The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me . . . ”** ([61:1](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+61%3A1/)). Jesus would quote this verse in Nazareth more than 500 years later ([Luke 4:17–21](https://www.esv.org/Luke+4%3A17%E2%80%9321/)).


## #37: Pig flesh
The Israelites were not the only ones who did not eat or sacrifice **pig flesh**. The Assyrians found the pig to be equally offensive, as do some people groups today. However, many other people groups ate and sacrificed them to their gods ([65:4](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+65%3A4/)).


## #38: Javan
The land of **Javan** was probably the Ionian region of Greece, which is the western coast of present-day Turkey. Isaiah says that even this far-off land would someday declare God’s glory among the nations ([66:19](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+66%3A19/)).
