# Psalms Facts

## #1: Where is Zion?
**Where is Zion?** Zion ([2:6](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+2%3A6/)) is the mountain where Jerusalem and the temple were built. The term “Zion” sometimes refers to ancient Jerusalem and sometimes stands for the permanent home where God’s people will live forever with him (see [Isa. 4:2–6; 12:1–6; 65:17–25](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+4%3A2%E2%80%936%2C+12%3A1%E2%80%936%2C+65%3A17%E2%80%9325/)).


## #2: A shield for his people
**A shield for his people.** Without the proper shield, an ancient warrior had little chance in battle. Psalms uses the term “shield” ([3:3](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+3%3A3/)) to describe God’s protection of his people.


## #3: How are the Psalms divided?
**How are the [Psalms](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+1%3A1%E2%80%93150%3A6/) divided?** The Psalms are divided into five books: [1–41](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+1%3A1%E2%80%9341%3A13/); [42–72](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+42%3A1%E2%80%9372%3A20/); [73–89](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+73%3A1%E2%80%9389%3A52/); [90–106](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+90%3A1%E2%80%93106%3A48/); [107–150](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+107%3A1%E2%80%93150%3A6/). Each book ends with a “doxology,” a hymn of praise to God.


## #4: What was the main purpose of the Psalms for the people of God?
**What was the main purpose of the [Psalms](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+1%3A1%E2%80%93150%3A6/) for the people of God?** The Psalms were the songbook of the people of God when they gathered for worship.


## #5: What is “Sheol”?
**What is “Sheol”?** In the OT, the Hebrew word “Sheol” ([9:17](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+9%3A17/)) refers to the place where people go when they die. It is similar to the Greek word “Hades.” Both words are usually translated “death” or “the grave.”


## #6: What is a psalm of lament?
**What is a psalm of lament?** The main purpose of a psalm of lament is to tell the Lord about a difficult situation, to ask him for his help, and to praise him for helping. Some laments are community, congregational psalms. Others are individual, personal laments. One third of all the [Psalms](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+1%3A1%E2%80%93150%3A6/) are psalms of lament.


## #7: How many of the Psalms were written by David?
**How many of the [Psalms](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+1%3A1%E2%80%93150%3A6/) were written by David?** David is the author of about half of the [Psalms](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+1%3A1%E2%80%93150%3A6/). Other authors include Asaph, Solomon, Moses, and the sons of Korah.


## #8: What is parallelism?
**What is parallelism?** Parallelism is one of the main features of Hebrew poetry. All 150 Psalms include parallelism. Typically, the main lines in a psalm are followed by secondary lines that either repeat or expand upon an idea in the main line.


## #9: What defined someone as an “enemy” of the people of Israel?
**What defined someone as an “enemy” of the people of Israel?** The “enemies” mentioned in the [Psalms](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+1%3A1%E2%80%93150%3A6/) (e.g., [18:17](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+18%3A17/)) were people hostile to the faith of God’s people. Sometimes they expressed their hatred by physically attacking the people of Israel, while other times they merely rejoiced when Israel faced misfortunes.


## #10: Are the Psalms poetry?
**Are the [Psalms](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+1%3A1%E2%80%93150%3A6/) poetry?** The Psalms often reflect the feelings or emotions of the person who wrote the psalm. The book of [Psalms](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+1%3A1%E2%80%93150%3A6/) includes poetry that covers all kinds of emotional feelings and experiences, from anguish and sorrow to great joy and thanksgiving.


## #11: What are royal psalms?
**What are royal psalms?** Royal psalms (e.g., 18)emphasize God’s promise to David that he would have an eternal kingdom ([2 Samuel 7](https://www.esv.org/2+Samuel+7%3A1%E2%80%9329/); [1 Chronicles 17](https://www.esv.org/1+Chronicles+17%3A1%E2%80%9327/)). David and his descendants are called to bless Israel and the nations of the world. Some of these psalms are praises, some are thanksgivings, and some are confessions of sin. The promises to David point to the Messiah, the ultimate heir of David.


## #12: How often does the NT quote from the Psalms?
**How often does the NT quote from the [Psalms](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+1%3A1%E2%80%93150%3A6/)?** Of all the OT books, the [Psalms](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+1%3A1%E2%80%93150%3A6/) and [Isaiah](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+1%3A1%E2%80%9366%3A24/) are by far the two most widely quoted in the NT.


## #13: Selah
What does ****Selah**** mean? Although the word **Selah** is found 39 times in the book of [Psalms](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+1%3A1%E2%80%93150%3A6/), its exact meaning is uncertain. Most scholars believe it is a musical term or a term to be used by a worship leader, possibly to mark a pause.


## #14: House of the Lord
The term **house of the Lord** ([27:4](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+27%3A4/)) always refers to the temple, where God in OT times lived among his people.


## #15: Summers in Israel
**Summers in Israel** can be very hot, depending on where one is (see [32:4](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+32%3A4/)). In places like Masada, near the Dead Sea, temperatures can soar past 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43° C) without a drop of rain. However, Jerusalem, with its higher elevation, remains cooler with temperatures between 75 and 85 degrees (24 to 29° C).


## #16: A harp or a lyre?
**A harp or a lyre?** Both harps and lyres were hand-held stringed instruments with wooden frames. (See [33:2](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+33%3A2/).)


## #17: Strong offense and defense
**Strong offense and defense.** The shield and buckler ([35:2](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+35%3A2/)) and the spear and javelin ([35:3](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+35%3A3/)) represented extremes in weaponry. While the shield was lighter and could be carried without the use of a helper, the larger buckler gave the warrior more protection. The javelin could be hurled at enemies from a distance while the spear served better in close combat.


## #18: Shadow of your wings
The phrase **shadow of your wings** ([36:7](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+36%3A7/)) is also found in two other psalms ([17:8; 57:1](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+17%3A8%2C+57%3A1/)). It symbolizes the protection and safety of the Lord.


## #19: Laurel tree
The **laurel tree** ([37:35](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+37%3A35/)) may be the sweet-bay tree, which is found all over the Mediterranean and can grow up to 60 feet (18 m) in height. Parts of the tree can be used for medicinal purposes while its leaves (bay leaves) can be used for seasoning food.


## #20: Snares
**Snares** ([38:12](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+38%3A12/)) were traps used to catch birds and animals. Some snares used ropes or nets that would be triggered as soon as the bait was touched. Pits disguised with sticks and leaves were also used as snares. In the [Psalms](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+1%3A1%E2%80%93150%3A6/), snares serve as symbols of danger or death at the hands of the wicked.


## #21: How long is a handbreadth?
**How long is a handbreadth?** A handbreadth ([39:5](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+39%3A5/)) was considered to be the width of the four fingers on one hand, or roughly 4 inches (10 cm).


## #22: Deer
There were at least three known species of **deer** in ancient Palestine. The red deer was the largest. The male could weigh up to 500 pounds (225 kg) while the female weighed up to 350 pounds (160 kg).


## #23: Forgetting the name of God
**Forgetting the name of God** ([44:20](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+44%3A20/)). Many of the pagan religions of OT times taught that a god’s power was tied directly to its name. The false prophets of Jeremiah’s time believed that, if they could erase God’s name from the people’s memory, they would follow Baal instead ([Jer. 23:26–27](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+23%3A26%E2%80%9327/)). However, God does not forget his people, even when they have forgotten him ([Deut. 4:31](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+4%3A31/)).


## #24: Fragrant robes
**Fragrant robes.** The anointing of a person did not always involve the use of oil. Plant extracts such as aloe, cassia (similar to cinnamon), and myrrh were used during celebrations such as weddings and coronations. The extracts would either be oiled or brushed onto the clothes to give off a pleasing aroma. (See [45:7–8](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+45%3A7%E2%80%938/).)


## #25: Hyssop
**Hyssop** is a member of the mint family. Its fuzzy leaves and branches produce bunches of small white or yellow flowers. During Passover, the people of Israel used hyssop branches to place blood above their doors and on their doorposts ([Ex. 12:22](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+12%3A22/)). In [Psalm 51](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+51%3A1%E2%80%9319/), hyssop symbolizes being cleansed from sin (see [Lev. 14:4–6](https://www.esv.org/Leviticus+14%3A4%E2%80%936/); [Num. 19:6](https://www.esv.org/Numbers+19%3A6/)).


## #26: There is none who does good
**There is none who does good**. In [Rom. 3:10–12](https://www.esv.org/Romans+3%3A10%E2%80%9312/), the apostle Paul cites [Ps. 53:1–3](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+53%3A1%E2%80%933/) to explain the universal human condition of sin. No person on his own seeks for God or does any good that merits salvation. Everyone needs the perfect Savior, Jesus Christ.


## #27: A helpful guide
**A helpful guide.** The writers of the [Psalms](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+1%3A1%E2%80%93150%3A6/) understood the importance of constant communication with God. They knew that God would hear their prayers, and they trusted him to act on their behalf. Believers today can benefit greatly by patterning their prayers after specific psalms.


## #28: Memorizing the Psalms
**Memorizing the [Psalms](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+1%3A1%E2%80%93150%3A6/).** The poetic style of the [Psalms](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+1%3A1%E2%80%93150%3A6/) make them easy to memorize. Throughout the centuries, many believers have memorized all 150 Psalms.


## #29: Pride
**Pride** ([59:12](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+59%3A12/)) is the opposite of humility. It means putting excessive confidence in one’s own abilities, wealth, or position. Pride causes a person to crave the glory and honor that belong only to God.


## #30: Banners
**Banners** served as battle flags in ancient wars. Attached to poles, they were used to signal troop movements or to serve as rallying points. Banners could be actual flags or they could be carved figures, often depicting a bird or animal. Each of the Israelite tribes may have had a banner to help organize the mass exodus out of Sinai. In [Psalm 60:4](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+60%3A4/), the banner is a symbol of God’s protection over those who trust him.


## #31: Dwell in God’s courts
The psalmist David’s desire to **dwell in God’s courts** ([65:4](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+65%3A4/)), that is, in the sanctuary, recalls his closing words in [Psalm 23](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+23%3A1%E2%80%936/): “and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.”


## #32: Wanting God’s blessing
**Wanting God’s blessing.** [Psalm 67](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+67%3A1%E2%80%937/) echoes the priestly blessing in [Num. 6:24–26](https://www.esv.org/Numbers+6%3A24%E2%80%9326/). Israel desires God’s blessing so that all nations may know of his saving power. God called Abram in order to bless him and his descendants and to make them a means of blessing to all the nations of the world ([Gen. 12:2–3](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+12%3A2%E2%80%933/)).


## #33: Ancient worship leaders
**Ancient worship leaders.** Psalm 68:24–27 mentions singers and musicians leading worship. Other passages, such as [1 Chron. 15:16–22](https://www.esv.org/1+Chronicles+15%3A16%E2%80%9322/), give details about some of the musical instruments that were used in Israelite worship.


## #34: The deep
**The deep.** In [Ps. 69:15](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+69%3A15/), “the deep” is a striking picture of the problems of life that can seem so frightening and overpowering. But the Lord, who created the world out of “the deep” ([Gen. 1:2](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+1%3A2/)), can rescue his people from all such problems.


## #35: Fortress
The term **fortress** ([71:3](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+71%3A3/)) could describe the city walls of ancient times. These walls, usually stone, included towers at strategic points so that the soldiers could see if anyone was trying to climb the wall. God is the believer’s true fortress, the only real source of protection.


## #36: Hope
**Hope** means putting one’s full confidence in God, who always keeps his promises. Believers can have hope for the future because of what God has done in the past. Created things will always ultimately disappoint. God alone is the source of true hope.


## #37: What does it mean to be “pure in heart”?
**What does it mean to be “pure in heart”?** Those who are pure in heart ([73:1](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+73%3A1/)) love God wholeheartedly ([Deut. 6:5](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+6%3A5/)). Their pursuit of purity and uprightness affects every area of life ([Matt. 5:8](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+5%3A8/)).


## #38: Horn
The **horn** could be a symbol of power and military strength, and thus to lift up or exalt it was to publicly assert power. God warns the ungodly not to lift up their horns ([75:4](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+75%3A4/)), and promises that he will lift up the horn of the faithful.


## #39: Zoan
**Zoan** ([78:12](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+78%3A12/)) is the ancient Egyptian city of Tanis, one of many cities in the area where the Israelites lived around the time of Moses. The city’s ruins were surveyed by Napoleon Bonaparte in the late 1700s.


## #40: How long?
**How long?** This question ([79:5](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+79%3A5/)) occurs nearly twenty times in the [Psalms](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+1%3A1%E2%80%93150%3A6/), more than any other question. It is almost always associated with a psalm of lament, such as [Psalm 79](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+79%3A1%E2%80%9313/).


## #41: En-dor
**En-dor** ([83:10](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+83%3A10/)) is perhaps most famous for being home to a spiritual medium whom Saul consulted on the eve of his final battle ([1 Sam. 28:7–25](https://www.esv.org/1+Samuel+28%3A7%E2%80%9325/)).


## #42: Blessed
The word **blessed** ([84:4, 5, 12](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+84%3A4%2C+84%3A5%2C+84%3A12/), etc.) refers to someone who has received—or who will receive—something good from the Lord. It is not just a temporary feeling of happiness but a state of well-being in relationship to God.


## #43: Song of the Lamb
The words of [Ps. 86:9](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+86%3A9/) are incorporated into the **song of the Lamb** in [Rev. 15:4](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+15%3A4/). All nations, from all around the globe, will someday worship the Lord.


## #44: Keeping a record of the population
**Keeping a record of the population** ([87:6](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+87%3A6/)) was a very important task in the ancient world. In fact, sometimes entire cities were employed for this purpose. People who performed such royal duties were sometimes rewarded by being exempt from imprisonment and military service, and from having to pay taxes.


## #45: Abaddon
**Abaddon** ([88:11](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+88%3A11/)) means “place of destruction.” In [Rev. 9:11](https://www.esv.org/Revelation+9%3A11/) Abaddon is king of “the bottomless pit.”


## #46: Finding your way
**Finding your way** in the ancient world was often an inexact science. Without a compass or map, topographical features such as oases and mountains were heavily relied upon. The few maps available were often unreliable because they may have been produced to mark a kingdom’s boundaries rather than as a tool for navigation.


## #47: How old?
**How old?** [Psalm 90:10](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+90%3A10/) suggests that Israelites were living to be 70 or 80 years old in the days of Moses. While life expectancy has varied somewhat over the centuries, it is about the same today.


## #48: Satan knows the Scriptures
**Satan knows the Scriptures.** [Psalm 91:11–12](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+91%3A11%E2%80%9312/) was quoted by Satan when he tempted Jesus in the desert ([Matt. 4:6](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+4%3A6/)). Of course, he misapplied it for his own evil purposes. In no way do these verses mean that believers should put themselves in unnecessary danger.


## #49: Vengeance
The word **vengeance** is used in [Ps. 94:1](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+94%3A1/) to describe one way in which the Lord brings about justice in the world. Individual Israelites were forbidden to seek personal vengeance ([Lev. 19:18](https://www.esv.org/Leviticus+19%3A18/)). However, it was the duty of the civil government to ensure just retribution against wrongdoers ([Ex. 21:20](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+21%3A20/)).


## #50: Maker of heaven and earth
**Maker of heaven and earth.** [Psalm 95](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+95%3A1%E2%80%9311/) is one of several psalms that focus on God’s rule over all of creation. God is the ultimate king because he created everything that exists. The Psalms frequently remind God’s people that we owe him our worship and allegiance because it is he who made us.


## #51: Joy to the world!
**Joy to the world!** [Psalm 98:4–9](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+98%3A4%E2%80%939/) inspired Isaac Watts to write his famous Christmas hymn, “Joy to the World,” in 1719. The song celebrates not only the birth of Christ but how creation itself rejoices at the return of her King, who “comes to judge the earth . . . with righteousness” ([98:9](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+98%3A9/)).


## #52: What is integrity?
**What is integrity?** When the Bible describes someone as having “integrity” ([101:2](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+101%3A2/)) it means that the person is characterized by good moral behavior. The Bible might also describe this person as “blameless” in the sight of God.


## #53: Ashes
**Ashes** were often used in the OT to express sorrow, humiliation, or feelings of worthlessness. In [Ps. 102:9](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+102%3A9/), they are a sign of mourning, as indicated by their mention along with tears. The prophet Jeremiah encouraged Israel to “roll in ashes” to mourn the destruction that would soon befall her ([Jer. 6:26](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+6%3A26/)).


## #54: Celebrate
[Psalms 105 and 106](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+105%3A1%E2%80%9345%2C+106%3A1%E2%80%9348/) **celebrate** God’s faithfulness to his people. They recall his promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Those who sing the psalms should see themselves as the beneficiaries of all the amazing things God has done in the past.


## #55: Murmured
Despite all the faithfulness and steadfast love God showed to his people, as [Psalm 105](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+105%3A1%E2%80%9345/) recounts, they **murmured** ([106:25](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+106%3A25/)), displaying a lack of contentment and trust in him. Such murmuring amounts to disobeying a gracious God who leads his people.


## #56: Steadfast love
What is God’s **steadfast love** to his people, for which [Psalm 107](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+107%3A1%E2%80%9343/) repeatedly says they should thank him? It is the enduring faithfulness, care, and kindness that he has promised to them. Even after their repeated disobedience, which brought his discipline, they cried out to him and he forgave them.


## #57: “Upon Edom I cast my shoe”
**“Upon Edom I cast my shoe”** ([108:9](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+108%3A9/)). In ancient times, people would sometimes lay claim to a parcel of land by walking its boundaries and then offering the shoes they had worn as their title of ownership. Here, the Lord is claiming Edom as his own.


## #58: The right hand
**The right hand** is often a symbol of authority and power. Kings wore their signet rings on their right hand ([Jer. 22:24](https://www.esv.org/Jeremiah+22%3A24/)), and a father blessed his oldest son with his right hand ([Gen. 48:14, 17](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+48%3A14%2C+48%3A17/)). In [Psalm 110](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+110%3A1%E2%80%937/), the right hand describes a place of honor and distinction. The Bible often refers to God’s right hand in his acts of blessing and deliverance ([Ex. 15:6](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+15%3A6/); [Ps. 16:11](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+16%3A11/)).


## #59: Two acrostic poems
**Two acrostic poems.** Because of their similar themes, [Psalms 111 and 112](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+111%3A1%E2%80%9310%2C+112%3A1%E2%80%9310/) can be seen as companion psalms. Both are also acrostic poems. In the acrostics of the OT, each line or verse begins with successive letters of the Hebrew alphabet.


## #60: Flint
**Flint** is a very hard variety of quartz that was plentiful in the land of the Bible. It could be broken into sharp pieces and used to make tools and weapons. Knives, arrowheads, sickle blades, and saws were all made from flint. The Bible often uses flint as a picture of strength and determination ([Isa. 50:7](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+50%3A7/); [Ezek. 3:9](https://www.esv.org/Ezekiel+3%3A9/)). In [Psalm 114](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+114%3A1%E2%80%938/), it provides a picture of God’s power over what he has created.


## #61: Idols
**Idols** ([115:4](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+115%3A4/)) represent anything allowed to compete with God for ultimate loyalty, robbing him of the devotion and glory he alone deserves. Idolatry is evil and foolish. God deserves our wholehearted love because nothing else compares with him.


## #62: A psalm of thanksgiving
**A psalm of thanksgiving.** The words of [Psalm 116](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+116%3A1%E2%80%9319/) are excellent for expressing public thanks after surviving a crisis situation.


## #63: Cornerstone
The **cornerstone** ([118:22](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+118%3A22/)) is the large shaped stone at the corner of the building’s foundation. It is essential to a structure’s stability. Several NT writers compared Jesus Christ to a cornerstone (e.g., [Matt. 21:42](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+21%3A42/); [Eph. 2:20](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+2%3A20/); [1 Pet. 2:4–8](https://www.esv.org/1+Peter+2%3A4%E2%80%938/)).


## #64: The longest psalm
Aside from being **the longest psalm**, [Psalm 119](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+119%3A1%E2%80%93176/) is also the longest and most carefully structured chapter in the Bible. The psalm is an acrostic poem of 22 stanzas, following the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Within each stanza, each verse begins with the same Hebrew letter.


## #65: Unique verses
**Unique verses.** Out of the 176 verses in [Psalm 119](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+119%3A1%E2%80%93176/), only seven lack an explicit mention of God’s Word: vv. [84, 90–91, 120, 122, 132, and 149](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+119%3A84%2C+119%3A90%E2%80%9391%2C+119%3A120%2C+119%3A122%2C+119%3A132%2C+119%3A149/).


## #66: Broom tree
The wood of the **broom tree** makes excellent **charcoal** ([120:4](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+120%3A4/)). Charcoal was an ideal source of fuel in Bible times because it was lightweight and created a hot fire that retained its heat for a long time.


## #67: Songs of Ascents
[Psalm 122](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+122%3A1%E2%80%939/) is one of the 15 **Songs of Ascents**, which were sung by worshipers who were on their way up to the temple. It reflects the joy of seeing God’s chosen city, Jerusalem, and being in the house of God to worship. The Songs of Ascents include [Psalms 120–134](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+120%3A1%E2%80%93134%3A3/).


## #68: What are fowlers?
**What are fowlers?** A “fowler” is someone who traps birds. In the Scriptures, it is used figuratively to describe active enemies of God’s people. The psalmist describes God as delivering his people from the fowler’s snare ([91:3; 124:7](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+91%3A3%2C+124%3A7/)).


## #69: Watchmen
**Watchmen** ([130:6](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+130%3A6/)) were stationed along the walls of ancient cities. They would sound an alarm if an enemy approached the city. Fields and vineyards also had watchmen to protect the grain and produce from thieves and animals.


## #70: What does it mean to “redeem” someone?
**What does it mean to “redeem” someone?** The word “redeem” expresses the idea of rescue and protection. The Psalms speak of God redeeming Israel ([44:26; 111:9](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+44%3A26%2C+111%3A9/)). God’s acts of redemption in the OT anticipate redemption from sin through the death of Jesus Christ ([Col. 1:13–14](https://www.esv.org/Colossians+1%3A13%E2%80%9314/)).


## #71: Anointing with oil
**Anointing with oil.** It was common during festivals for people to have their foreheads anointed with fragrant oils. This not only provided a pleasant aroma but gave the person a glistening look of good health. (See [133:2](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+133%3A2/).)


## #72: What is “renown”?
**What is “renown”?** The word “renown” refers to being well-known or specially honored. In [135:13](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+135%3A13/), it could also mean a “remembrance.” [Psalm 135](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+135%3A1%E2%80%9321/) echoes the words of [Ex. 3:15](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+3%3A15/): “This is my name forever, and thus I am to be remembered throughout all generations.”


## #73: Wonders
**Wonders** can also be translated “marvels.” The word is often used to describe God’s works of rescuing his people and protecting and caring for them ([9:1; 78:11; 98:1](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+9%3A1%2C+78%3A11%2C+98%3A1/); [Ex. 3:20; 34:10](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+3%3A20%2C+34%3A10/)). In [Ps. 136:4](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+136%3A4/), it describes creation, showing that God’s work as Creator should fill us with awe and wonder.


## #74: The Lord protects his people
**The Lord protects his people.** [Psalm 138](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+138%3A1%E2%80%938/) tells of God’s constant care for everyone who loves him. Singing this psalm helps believers be more aware of the ways in which God preserves and protects them.


## #75: Salvation
In the OT, **salvation** generally refers to deliverance from both physical and spiritual danger. Because God had been a faithful Savior in the past, Israel trusted that they could look forward to his greater salvation in the future. The ultimate salvation for all mankind would come through Jesus the Messiah.


## #76: Who are the saints?
**Who are the saints?** The term “saints” is used in both the OT and NT to describe God’s people. In the OT it describes the faithful among God’s people Israel ([37:28; 145:10](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+37%3A28%2C+145%3A10/)). In the NT, the Greek word translated “saints” means “holy,” in the sense of being set apart for God. This includes all those, no matter what their background, who have put their trust in Jesus, the only one who can truly make them holy.


## #77: Two-edged swords
**Two-edged swords** ([149:6](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+149%3A6/)) were made of bronze or iron and were filed on each side, so that the blade could more readily and deeply penetrate enemy armor. In the NT, the word of God is said to be “sharper than any two-edged sword” ([Heb. 4:12](https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+4%3A12/)) because of the way it exposes the deepest “thoughts and intentions” of a person’s heart.
