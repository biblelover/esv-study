# 1-Peter Facts

## #1: Preparing your minds for action
The Greek phrase translated **preparing your minds for action** ([1:13](https://www.esv.org/1+Peter+1%3A13/)) was used to describe the action of wrapping one’s robes around one’s belt before beginning some physical activity. The modern equivalent would be “rolling up your sleeves.” Christians should be prepared to fully engage their minds in their service for Christ.


## #2: What is God’s purpose for civil government?
**What is God’s purpose for civil government?** God has established civil governments around the world in order to punish wrongdoers and promote the good of society ([Rom. 13:1–4](https://www.esv.org/Romans+13%3A1%E2%80%934/)). Peter teaches believers to “be subject for the Lord’s sake to every human institution” ([1 Pet. 2:13–17](https://www.esv.org/1+Peter+2%3A13%E2%80%9317/); see [1 Tim. 2:1–2](https://www.esv.org/1+Timothy+2%3A1%E2%80%932/)).


## #3: Husbands and wives
**Husbands and wives.** Peter’s statement about wives being heirs with their husbands ([3:7](https://www.esv.org/1+Peter+3%3A7/)) was revolutionary. In Roman tradition, the husband usually decided which religion his family would follow. Christian husbands, however, are to honor their wives as their equals in God’s sight (see [Gal. 3:28](https://www.esv.org/Galatians+3%3A28/)).


## #4: The fiery trial
**The fiery trial.** Peter warned his readers that they would soon endure a “fiery trial” ([4:12](https://www.esv.org/1+Peter+4%3A12/)). In other words, they should expect persecution. He probably wrote this letter not long before the Roman emperor Nero began a campaign of persecution against Christians in Rome.


## #5: Kiss of love
A **kiss of love** ([5:14](https://www.esv.org/1+Peter+5%3A14/)) was simply a kiss on the cheek. It was usually practiced among family members. Both Peter and Paul encouraged believers to greet one another in this fashion because it reminded them that they were brothers and sisters in Christ. Such a greeting is still common in some parts of the world today.
