# 1-Samuel Facts

## #1: Children
**Children** were of great importance in ancient times for several reasons. They carried on the family name and helped to care for the family’s flocks and herds. Women who could not have children were often looked down upon because children were considered a blessing from the Lord. It was common for children to die as infants, so couples would often have many children, knowing some would not survive.


## #2: “Thus says the Lord.”
**“Thus says the Lord.”** Ancient messengers would begin their message by stating the sender’s name and saying, “[The sender’s name] has spoken thus.” The message would then be delivered in the first person as if the sender were saying it himself ([2:27](https://www.esv.org/1+Samuel+2%3A27/)).


## #3: Samuel! Samuel!
**Samuel! Samuel!** When God called Samuel to his service, he called out his name twice ([3:10](https://www.esv.org/1+Samuel+3%3A10/)). Abraham, Jacob, and Moses also heard the Lord speak their name twice at a crucial point in their lives.


## #4: The term “Hebrews”
**The term “Hebrews”** is used in [4:6](https://www.esv.org/1+Samuel+4%3A6/) by the Philistines to describe the Israelites as an ethnic group. The term literally means “descendants of Eber” ([Gen. 10:21–25](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+10%3A21%E2%80%9325/)). After David established the monarchy, the nation was referred to as “Israel” rather than “the Hebrews.”


## #5: Why the offering of golden mice and tumors?
**Why the offering of golden mice and tumors?** The tumors that afflicted the Philistines were most likely inflamed lymph nodes. This is the most common symptom of bubonic plague, which is often spread through rodents such as mice. Therefore, in order to appease the God of Israel, the Philistines sent gold replicas of the mice and tumors ([6:17](https://www.esv.org/1+Samuel+6%3A17/)).


## #6: Ebenezer
**Ebenezer** ([7:12](https://www.esv.org/1+Samuel+7%3A12/)) means “stone of help.” The monument was raised to remember the victory of the Israelites over the Philistines. Samuel chose to name it after the place where the Philistines first defeated the Israelites. This monument represented a chance of a fresh start for Israel because God had changed their circumstances and restored them as a nation.


## #7: A gift for the prophet
**A gift for the prophet.** Gift-giving was an important custom in the social dealings of the ancient world, as is often the case today in various cultures around the world. It was expected that a person seeking knowledge from a prophet would give a gift in exchange ([9:6–8](https://www.esv.org/1+Samuel+9%3A6%E2%80%938/)).


## #8: Musical instruments
Though **musical instruments** were used to induce trances in pagan worship, the Israelites used them for pleasing the Lord. The instruments used by the prophets in [10:5](https://www.esv.org/1+Samuel+10%3A5/) were the same ones used during feasts ([Isa. 5:12](https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+5%3A12/)).


## #9: A king is crowned
**A king is crowned.** Saul becomes the first king of all 12 tribes of Israel in ch. [12](https://www.esv.org/1+Samuel+12%3A1%E2%80%9325/). Only three kings (Saul, David, and Solomon) ruled the entire nation before the people divided into the nations of Israel and Judah.


## #10: Lord of lords
**Lord of lords.** Beginning with Saul and David, kings ruled over Israel. But kings did not have supreme authority. That position still belonged to the Lord. Any king who undermined the authority of the Lord or the words he sent through his prophets would eventually see his kingdom fail.


## #11: Jonathan shows his trust in God
**Jonathan shows his trust in God** when he says, “nothing can hinder the Lord from saving by many or by few” ([14:6](https://www.esv.org/1+Samuel+14%3A6/)). The Lord blesses him and gives him victory over the Philistine army ([14:1–23](https://www.esv.org/1+Samuel+14%3A1%E2%80%9323/)). In contrast, Saul disobeys God and loses his kingship.


## #12: Why did Saul spare the Kenites
**Why did Saul spare the Kenites**? Moses’ father-in-law Jethro was a Kenite. Jethro and his son were helpful and kind to the Israelites when they came out of Egypt. Because of this, David also showed favor to the Kenites when he became king.


## #13: A battle of champions
**A battle of champions.** To save lives, the outcomes of battles were at times decided by one-on-one combat ([17:4](https://www.esv.org/1+Samuel+17%3A4/)). A champion was selected from the opposing armies to fight each other. Both sides assumed that the gods had thereby determined the winning side.


## #14: Fed to the birds and beasts
**Fed to the birds and beasts.** In Israel, being killed and left for scavenger birds, like vultures, was considered shameful ([17:46](https://www.esv.org/1+Samuel+17%3A46/)). It deprived a person of a meaningful burial where family members could properly mourn.


## #15: The sound of victory
**The sound of victory.** The sight of women singing, dancing, and playing tambourines was very common following a military victory ([18:6](https://www.esv.org/1+Samuel+18%3A6/)). Ancient clay figurines or plaques showing women playing tambourines have been found in Israel.


## #16: What was the significance of the new moon?
**What was the significance of the new moon?** The new moon was the day of the first appearance of the crescent moon in the western sky at sunset. This marked the beginning of the month in the lunar calendar. One of the main festivals in Israelite society was held at the time of the new moon.


## #17: Nob
After the destruction of Shiloh, **Nob** apparently became the city where the priests and Levites lived. Although its exact location is unknown, it was probably a mile or two north of Jerusalem. After the building of the temple, Jerusalem became the nation’s official religious center.


## #18: Psalms of deliverance
**Psalms of deliverance.** Many of the psalms of David were composed during his time spent on the run from Saul.


## #19: Why was David sorry after he had cut Saul’s robe?
**Why was David sorry after he had cut Saul’s robe?** The cutting of another person’s clothes ([24:5](https://www.esv.org/1+Samuel+24%3A5/)) was considered an act of humiliation and provocation. Thus, it could lead to war ([2 Sam. 10:4–5](https://www.esv.org/2+Samuel+10%3A4%E2%80%935/)). David realizes that doing this to the Lord’s anointed one is an offense against the Lord himself.


## #20: “Go, serve other gods.”
**“Go, serve other gods.”** Telling a fellow Israelite to go and serve other gods ([26:19](https://www.esv.org/1+Samuel+26%3A19/)) was a capital offense against the Lord. For non-Israelites, it was a commonly accepted practice to serve the gods of the nation where one lived, regardless of one’s own national gods.


## #21: How is a fattened calf different from a regular calf?
**How is a fattened calf different from a regular calf?** A fattened calf ([28:24](https://www.esv.org/1+Samuel+28%3A24/)) was one that had been set aside for a special occasion. While most cattle simply grazed in fields, these select animals were fed in a stall. The extra food and the inability to roam freely meant that they would gain more weight.


## #22: Pressed fig cakes
**Pressed fig cakes** were a common food for travelers ([30:12](https://www.esv.org/1+Samuel+30%3A12/)). The dried figs would not spoil, and their sugar content made them an ideal energy food.
