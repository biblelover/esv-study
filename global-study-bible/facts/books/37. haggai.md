# Haggai Facts

## #1:  paneled houses
The** paneled houses** described in [1:4](https://www.esv.org/Haggai+1%3A4/) probably had walls and ceilings covered with cedar wood. Such decoration was a sign of prosperity in a land where wood was scarce. The people were spending freely on their own homes while neglecting the rebuilding of the temple.


## #2: Temple
The **temple** was the means through which God dwelt with his people in meaningful fellowship ([1:13; 2:4–5](https://www.esv.org/Haggai+1%3A13%2C+2%3A4%E2%80%935/)). It also brought glory and pleasure to God ([1:8](https://www.esv.org/Haggai+1%3A8/)). Jesus said that he was the final temple, restoring fellowship once more between God and his people ([John 2:19–22](https://www.esv.org/John+2%3A19%E2%80%9322/); [Eph. 2:19–22](https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+2%3A19%E2%80%9322/)).
