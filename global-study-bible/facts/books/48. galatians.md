# Galatians Facts

## #1: Paul’s letter to the Galatians
**Paul’s letter to the Galatians** was likely written to the churches he established in the southern part of Galatia during his first missionary journey ([Acts 13:1–14:28](https://www.esv.org/Acts+13%3A1%E2%80%9314%3A28/)). He probably sent the letter from his home church in Antioch, sometime before the Jeru­salem council (see [Acts 15:1–31](https://www.esv.org/Acts+15%3A1%E2%80%9331/)).


## #2: Justification by faith alone
**Justification by faith alone.** False teachers were trying to persuade the Galatians that they needed to practice circumcision and other outward ceremonies of the Mosaic law in order to be right with God. But Paul explains that only through faith in Christ can one be right with God ([2:16](https://www.esv.org/Galatians+2%3A16/)).


## #3: God’s promises to Abraham
**God’s promises to Abraham.** When Abraham believed God’s promises to him, God counted his faith as righteousness ([Gen. 15:6](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+15%3A6/)). Paul uses this precedent to show that God’s promises to Abraham are for all who “hear with faith,” not just the people of Israel ([Gal. 3:1–29](https://www.esv.org/Galatians+3%3A1%E2%80%9329/)).


## #4: False teachers
“They” in [4:17](https://www.esv.org/Galatians+4%3A17/) refers to the **false teachers** who were trying to persuade the Galatian believers that Paul was wrong about certain important issues. They avoided persecution and gained favor from the Jews by requiring circumcision ([6:12–13](https://www.esv.org/Galatians+6%3A12%E2%80%9313/)).


## #5: Walk by the Spirit
To **walk by the Spirit** means making decisions and choices based on the Holy Spirit’s guidance ([5:16, 25](https://www.esv.org/Galatians+5%3A16%2C+5%3A25/)). It also involves relying on the Spirit’s power to conquer sinful desires ([5:17–18](https://www.esv.org/Galatians+5%3A17%E2%80%9318/)). The Spirit will produce “fruits” of godliness in the believer’s life ([5:22–23](https://www.esv.org/Galatians+5%3A22%E2%80%9323/)).
