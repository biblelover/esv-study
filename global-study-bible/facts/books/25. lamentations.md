# Lamentations Facts

## #1: A book named “How”?
**A book named “How”?** In the Hebrew Bible, the title of the book of [Lamentations](https://www.esv.org/Lamentations+1%3A1%E2%80%935%3A22/) is actually “How.” This is the first word in the book, and it occurs again at the beginning of chs. [2 and 4](https://www.esv.org/Lamentations+2%3A1%E2%80%9322%2C+4%3A1%E2%80%9322/). It expresses “how” much Jerusalem has suffered.


## #2: Stretching out the measuring line
**Stretching out the measuring line** ([2:8](https://www.esv.org/Lamentations+2%3A8/)) is a military action. If the army did not have enough troops to guard a captured city, they might measure out certain lengths of wall to destroy. By doing this, they ensured that the city could not defend itself if it tried to rebel against its new captors.


## #3: Wormwood
**Wormwood** was a bitter-tasting shrub that grew wild along the rocky slopes of Palestine. In Scripture, its bitter taste is often symbolic of hardship and sorrow.


## #4: The fall of Jerusalem
**The fall of Jerusalem.** Jerusalem had been invaded several times, but had always survived. Finally, however, because of the people’s continued rebellion, the Lord allowed the Babylonians to conquer Jerusalem in 586 b.c. Chapter [4](https://www.esv.org/Lamentations+4%3A1%E2%80%9322/) contrasts Judah’s glory days with its pitiful state after judgment.


## #5: Lamentations
**[Lamentations](https://www.esv.org/Lamentations+1%3A1%E2%80%935%3A22/)** contains five poems that mourn the fall of Judah and the sin that caused it. Chapters [1–3 and 4](https://www.esv.org/Lamentations+1%3A1%E2%80%933%3A66%2C+4%3A1%E2%80%9322/) are acrostic poems. This means that each verse starts with a different letter of the Hebrew alphabet, in alphabetical order. [Psalm 119](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+119%3A1%E2%80%93176/) is another example of an acrostic poem.
