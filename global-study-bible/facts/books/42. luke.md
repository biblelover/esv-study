# Luke Facts

## #1: Who wrote Luke?
**Who wrote Luke?** Luke wrote both this Gospel account and [Acts](https://www.esv.org/Acts+1%3A1%E2%80%9328%3A31/). He probably traveled with Paul and participated in his ministry (see [Col. 4:14](https://www.esv.org/Colossians+4%3A14/); [2 Tim. 4:11](https://www.esv.org/2+Timothy+4%3A11/); [Philem. 24](https://www.esv.org/Philemon+24/)). Luke was also a physician ([Col. 4:14](https://www.esv.org/Colossians+4%3A14/)).


## #2: Mary’s song
**Mary’s song** includes one of Luke’s major themes: the great reversal taking place in the world, in which God will exalt the humble and humble the proud ([1:48, 52–53](https://www.esv.org/Luke+1%3A48%2C+1%3A52%E2%80%9353/)). God often uses seemingly insignificant people to achieve his remarkable purposes.


## #3: Why was Jesus taken to Jerusalem at age 12?
**Why was Jesus taken to Jerusalem at age 12?** At age 13, a Jewish boy was considered a man. It is possible that Joseph and Mary took Jesus to Jerusalem as part of his final preparation for this new stage in his life.


## #4: What is a tetrarch?
**What is a tetrarch?** A tetrarch ([3:1](https://www.esv.org/Luke+3%3A1/)) ruled over part of a region. Herod Antipas became the tetrarch of Galilee when his father, Herod the Great, died in 4 b.c. Luke lists the names of rulers in order to show the historical accuracy of his writing (see [1:1–4](https://www.esv.org/Luke+1%3A1%E2%80%934/)).


## #5: Pinnacle of the temple
The **pinnacle of the temple** ([4:9](https://www.esv.org/Luke+4%3A9/)) was probably located at the southeastern corner of the Temple Mount. It overlooked the steep drop into the Kidron Valley, some 300 feet (91 m) below.


## #6: Temptations
Jesus endured many **temptations** from Satan in the wilderness, designed to discourage him in his ministry. But he met each temptation with a specific Scripture that addressed that particular temptation. We should follow his example.


## #7: Pharisees
The **Pharisees** may have originated from the **Hasidim**, Jewish separatists who fought for independence in the Maccabean Revolt. Unlike the Sadducees, who controlled the Jewish high court, the Pharisees were heavily involved in the local synagogues. They were popular with the people, but Jesus challenged them on many points.


## #8: The Golden Rule
**The Golden Rule.** In [6:31](https://www.esv.org/Luke+6%3A31/), Jesus teaches that his followers should treat others as they want to be treated. This is known as “the Golden Rule,” and it is a good summary of OT teaching ([Matt. 7:12](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+7%3A12/)). Since God is kind and merciful, his children should be too ([Luke 6:32–36](https://www.esv.org/Luke+6%3A32%E2%80%9336/)).


## #9: Are you the one who is to come?
**Are you the one who is to come?** John the Baptist sent his disciples to ask Jesus if he was the “mightier one,” or the Messiah, who would come after John. In response, Jesus pointed out how his ministry fulfilled Isaiah’s prophecies about the Messiah ([7:18–23](https://www.esv.org/Luke+7%3A18%E2%80%9323/); see [3:16](https://www.esv.org/Luke+3%3A16/)).


## #10: Cast out demons
Traveling exorcists tried to **cast out demons** using a variety of spells and devices. Jesus cast out demons using simple commands. This demonstrated his unique authority as the Son of God and showed that Jesus was stronger than any evil power ([8:26–39](https://www.esv.org/Luke+8%3A26%E2%80%9339/)).


## #11: An early outreach to Gentiles
**An early outreach to Gentiles.** When Jesus healed a demon-possessed man in a Gentile area ([8:26–39](https://www.esv.org/Luke+8%3A26%E2%80%9339/)), the healed man became an early “missionary” to his fellow Gentiles. The mission to the Gentiles would not begin in earnest until after Pentecost ([Acts 2](https://www.esv.org/Acts+2%3A1%E2%80%9347/)).


## #12: Bethsaida
Was **Bethsaida** ([9:10](https://www.esv.org/Luke+9%3A10/)) actually a fishing village on the Sea of Galilee, as [Mark 6:45](https://www.esv.org/Mark+6%3A45/) suggests? The most likely site for Bethsaida is 1.25 miles (2 km) inland from the Sea. However, recent archaeological research has shown that this can be explained by (1) a lowering of the water level in the Sea, (2) sedimentation, and (3) seismic activity.


## #13: Children
Jesus welcomed **children** and sometimes used them as examples of humility ([10:21; 18:15–17](https://www.esv.org/Luke+10%3A21%2C+18%3A15%E2%80%9317/)). He taught that such humility was necessary for his followers (see [Matt. 18:3–4](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+18%3A3%E2%80%934/)). God delights in showing mercy to those who are humble (see [Luke 1:52–53](https://www.esv.org/Luke+1%3A52%E2%80%9353/)).


## #14: The coming of God’s kingdom
**The coming of God’s kingdom** ([11:2](https://www.esv.org/Luke+11%3A2/)) is an important theme in the Gospels. It refers to the advance of God’s rule over all creation, especially as sinful men and women put their trust in Jesus and submit to God’s authority in their lives.


## #15: “woes”
In [11:42–52](https://www.esv.org/Luke+11%3A42%E2%80%9352/), Jesus directs six **“woes”** to the Pharisees and the lawyers (or scribes). “Woe” is a way of expressing grief or regret. The Pharisees and scribes took offense, but Jesus’ teaching should have led them to repentance.


## #16: Worth more than a sparrow?
**Worth more than a sparrow?** Five sparrows could be purchased for two pennies. However, even the common sparrow is of great worth in God’s sight. And if that is so, Jesus says, each human person must be of infinite worth to him ([12:6–7](https://www.esv.org/Luke+12%3A6%E2%80%937/)).


## #17: Heal people on the sabbath
The synagogue ruler thought that Jesus was wrong to **heal people on the sabbath** ([13:14](https://www.esv.org/Luke+13%3A14/)). Keeping the sabbath meant resting from work, and some people thought that healing should be considered work. But there was actually no biblical law against healing on the Sabbath.


## #18: Too late for excuses
**Too late for excuses.** Planning a banquet was complicated and expensive. Two invitations were sent. The first required the guest to respond if they were attending so the host could determine how much food to prepare. The second would have gone out on the day of the banquet, announcing that the meal was ready. The ungrateful guests in [14:16–24](https://www.esv.org/Luke+14%3A16%E2%80%9324/) made their excuses upon receiving the second notice, after the host had already prepared the meal.


## #19: Pods
The **pods** mentioned in [15:16](https://www.esv.org/Luke+15%3A16/) are most likely carob pods. The pods of the carob tree were used for animal feed, but poor people often ate them as well.


## #20: The rich man and Lazarus
**The rich man and Lazarus.** Luke emphasizes God’s love for the poor, outcasts, sinners, and the weak. Many of the stories in his Gospel focus on this theme, including [16:19–31](https://www.esv.org/Luke+16%3A19%E2%80%9331/).


## #21: How difficult it is for a rich person
**How difficult it is for a rich person.** In [18:18–30](https://www.esv.org/Luke+18%3A18%E2%80%9330/), Jesus challenges a rich ruler to give his money to the poor. However, the man refuses because his riches matter more to him than obeying Jesus. Elsewhere, Jesus warns that it is impossible to serve both God and money ([16:13](https://www.esv.org/Luke+16%3A13/)).


## #22: Olivet
**Olivet** ([19:29](https://www.esv.org/Luke+19%3A29/)), also known as the** Mount of Olives**, is a high mountain ridge stretching some 2.5 miles (4 km) in a north-to-south direction just east of Jerusalem. Throughout Israel’s history, it was an ideal location from which to see approaching armies. It is also where Jesus ascended into heaven with the promise to return in the same way ([24:51](https://www.esv.org/Luke+24%3A51/); [Acts 1:11–12](https://www.esv.org/Acts+1%3A11%E2%80%9312/); see also [Zech. 14:4](https://www.esv.org/Zechariah+14%3A4/)).


## #23: The widow’s offering
**The widow’s offering.** There were 13 collection chests for offerings in the temple. The widow’s contribution caught Jesus’ eye not because it was impressive but because she had given sacrificially. The attitude of the giver is more important to God than the size of the gift.


## #24: Temple
The **temple** mentioned in the Gospels was the second one. The Babylonians destroyed the first temple, which Solomon had built. The Jews rebuilt it, and Herod the Great fully restored it later. Shortly after Jesus’ prophecy ([21:6](https://www.esv.org/Luke+21%3A6/)), this temple was destroyed, in a.d. 70.


## #25: Jesus knows us
**Jesus knows us.** Jesus knew that, in his hour of greatest need, Peter would deny him ([22:34](https://www.esv.org/Luke+22%3A34/)). He also knew that Peter would repent and go on to be a great leader in the church (v. [32](https://www.esv.org/Luke+22%3A32/); see [Acts 2:14–41](https://www.esv.org/Acts+2%3A14%E2%80%9341/)). As Paul declared, “The Lord knows those who are his” ([2 Tim. 2:19](https://www.esv.org/2+Timothy+2%3A19/)).


## #26: Take this cup from me
**Take this cup from me.** Drinking cups were often mentioned in the Bible as symbols of God’s wrath or judgment. For Jesus to figuratively drink from such a cup meant suffering God’s punishment on behalf of sinful people ([22:42](https://www.esv.org/Luke+22%3A42/)). This is what he willingly did when he died on the cross.


## #27: The entrance to the tomb
**The entrance to the tomb** where Jesus was buried was probably about 2 feet (0.6 m) wide and 3 feet (0.9 m) tall. It was covered with a stone, perhaps a foot (0.3 m) thick and 4 feet (1.2 m) in diameter. The body would have been placed on a bench until it could be prepared for burial.


## #28: Resurrected as real people!
**Resurrected as real people!** After his resurrection, Jesus had a real physical body. He was not just a disembodied spirit. He could eat and be touched ([24:39–43](https://www.esv.org/Luke+24%3A39%E2%80%9343/)). Christians will also experience real, physical resurrection from the dead ([1 Corinthians 15](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+15%3A1%E2%80%9358/)).
