# 2-Samuel Facts

## #1: Laments
**Laments** were a common way of showing grief and mourning for the dead. They could poetically capture a person’s feelings toward the departed.


## #2: The pool of Gibeon
**The pool of Gibeon** ([2:13](https://www.esv.org/2+Samuel+2%3A13/)) was probably a huge round cistern cut into limestone rock. Since the water was about 80 feet (24 m) below ground, nearly 30 feet (9 m) of stairs were carved into the side of the shaft. These stairs led to a tunnel about 40 feet (12 m) long. At the end of this tunnel was the pool, where a person could draw water for daily use.


## #3: Dogs
**Dogs** are mentioned 40 times in Scripture, and few of the references are positive. Dogs were viewed as unclean animals because they were scavengers, not pets. To compare someone to a dog was a great insult ([3:8](https://www.esv.org/2+Samuel+3%3A8/)).


## #4: Hanging
**Hanging** by the neck was never used as a form of execution in ancient Israel. However, the hanging of a person’s body after execution was a common practice ([4:12](https://www.esv.org/2+Samuel+4%3A12/)). This was done to cast shame on the criminal and to warn others not to commit similar crimes.


## #5: Millo
**Millo** means “fill” in Hebrew. The Millo ([5:9](https://www.esv.org/2+Samuel+5%3A9/)) was a series of terraces built so that houses and other structures could rest on flat areas of land. A retaining wall would first be built and then workers would “fill” dirt in behind it, piling it up until it formed a raised terrace.


## #6: Dancing
**Dancing** was a vital part of both worship and celebration ([6:14](https://www.esv.org/2+Samuel+6%3A14/)). The Hebrew word for dance can mean to twist or whirl about in circular movements or to leap or skip. Performed by both males and females, it was quite similar to traditional dancing in some parts of the world today.


## #7: Building a house for gods
**Building a house for gods** was a common thing for a king or leader to do in the ancient Near East. David’s desire to build a temple for the Lord ([7:6–7](https://www.esv.org/2+Samuel+7%3A6%E2%80%937/)) may have been influenced by this tradition. Ultimately, however, the temple was built only because the Lord directed that David’s son Solomon “shall build a house for my name” ([7:13](https://www.esv.org/2+Samuel+7%3A13/)).


## #8: Hamstringing horses
**Hamstringing horses** ([8:4](https://www.esv.org/2+Samuel+8%3A4/)) was a practice used by victorious armies to ensure that their enemy’s horses could not be used in battle again. It involved severing the leg tendon on the horse so that it could not gallop. Though it was a cruel act, many of the horses could still be used for farming.


## #9: Sexual activity while on military duty
**Sexual activity while on military duty** was expressly forbidden by law in ancient Israel. It brought about ritual impurity and therefore forced a soldier to undergo purification rituals. This would prevent him from performing his military duty.


## #10: David’s disobedience
**David’s disobedience.** David broke three of the Ten Commandments in his relationship with Bath­sheba. He broke the tenth commandment by coveting another man’s wife, then the seventh commandment by committing adultery. He broke the sixth commandment by arranging the death of Bathsheba’s husband, Uriah.


## #11: Why did Tamar not want to be sent away?
**Why did Tamar not want to be sent away?** Although Amnon raped her, Tamar knew that the Mosaic Law said he must now marry her or pay damages for what he had done. Though she told her father David what had happened, he did nothing to punish Amnon ([13:20](https://www.esv.org/2+Samuel+13%3A20/)-22). Both Amnon and David ignored God’s standards in this sad episode.


## #12: Geshur
**Geshur** was a border town between the nation of Israel and Aram to the north. David’s wife and Absalom’s mother, Maacah, was from this city, which may explain why Absalom fled there.


## #13: Regicide
**Regicide** is the act of murdering a king. In most cases, a person who killed a king was trying to place himself on the throne.


## #14: A stiff penalty
**A stiff penalty.** The punishment for cursing God ([Lev. 24:10–23](https://www.esv.org/Leviticus+24%3A10%E2%80%9323/)), the king ([Ex. 22:28](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+22%3A28/)), or one’s parents ([Lev. 20:9](https://www.esv.org/Leviticus+20%3A9/)) was death. Shimei cursed King David ([2 Sam. 16:5–14](https://www.esv.org/2+Samuel+16%3A5%E2%80%9314/)), but later begged David’s forgiveness, and David forgave him ([19:16–23](https://www.esv.org/2+Samuel+19%3A16%E2%80%9323/)).


## #15: Ropes with grappling hooks
When attacking a city, **ropes with grappling hooks** were often used to bring down its walls ([17:13](https://www.esv.org/2+Samuel+17%3A13/)). Since most cities were built on hills, the attackers could simply pull the walls away and down the slopes of the hill.


## #16: The forest of Ephraim
**The forest of Ephraim** was east of the Jordan River in Gilead. Gilead was known for its forests, and there David’s men would have a tactical advantage against a larger force.


## #17: Kissing
**Kissing** was a cultural means of showing respect, friendship, or reverence, as it is in many places today. A kiss was often given as a form of greeting or farewell ([19:39](https://www.esv.org/2+Samuel+19%3A39/)). There are only three places in all of Scripture where kissing is connected with romance ([Prov. 7:13](https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+7%3A13/), [Song 1:2; 8:1](https://www.esv.org/Song+of+Solomon+1%3A2%2C+8%3A1/).).


## #18: Barley
**Barley** was an essential grain for the Israelite people and their livestock ([21:9](https://www.esv.org/2+Samuel+21%3A9/)). A failed barley crop could spell disaster for a whole community.


## #19: Song of Deliverance
David’s **Song of Deliverance** is nearly identical to [Psalm 18](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+18%3A1%E2%80%9350/). Perhaps [2 Samuel 22](https://www.esv.org/2+Samuel+22%3A1%E2%80%9351/) was meant to be read aloud for instruction and [Psalm 18](https://www.esv.org/Psalms+18%3A1%E2%80%9350/) was meant to be sung or prayed as part of worship.


## #20: David’s census
**David’s census** was most likely a military census. Its purpose would have been to find the age and location of potential new draftees for service in the army. It was either intended to give David pride in the number of his supporters or was a sign of his fear of another rebellion. Either way, it showed his lack of faith in God.
