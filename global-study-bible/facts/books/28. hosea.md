# Hosea Facts

## #1: Hosea
**Hosea** comes from the same verb as “Joshua” and “Jesus,” meaning “to save" or "to deliver.” The message of the Bible is one of salvation for people of all different ethnicities and backgrounds all around the globe.


## #2: Public humiliation
**Public humiliation** was a standard punishment for adultery in the ancient world ([2:3](https://www.esv.org/Hosea+2%3A3/)). Rather than follow that custom, however, Hosea sought to reclaim his wife. This is a picture of the Lord, who seeks to reclaim his people even when they forsake him.


## #3:  piece of wood
The** piece of wood** mentioned in [4:12](https://www.esv.org/Hosea+4%3A12/) refers to the wooden idols worshiped by Canaanites. God’s people had sunk so low that they would even “inquire of a piece of wood” rather than seek guidance from the Lord.


## #4: Treacherous bow
To describe the Israelites as a **treacherous bow** ([7:16](https://www.esv.org/Hosea+7%3A16/)) means that they were undependable and even dangerous to those who relied on them. If a bow was improperly stored when not in use, the dry Mediterranean heat would make it brittle, causing it to snap and injure its user.


## #5: Worship God alone!
**Worship God alone!** Worship of the calf idol ([8:6](https://www.esv.org/Hosea+8%3A6/)) violated the First and Second Commandments: “You shall have no other gods before me,” and “You shall not make . . . a carved image . . .” ([Ex. 20:3–6](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+20%3A3%E2%80%936/)). Believers are to worship the Creator God, rather than created things.


## #6: Admah and Zeboiim
**Admah and Zeboiim** were destroyed along with Sodom and Gomorrah ([Genesis 18–19](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+18%3A1%E2%80%9319%3A38/); see [Deut. 29:23](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+29%3A23/)). Though God’s rebellious people often deserve the same fate, his compassion restrains him from destroying them ([Hos. 11:8](https://www.esv.org/Hosea+11%3A8/)).


## #7:  leopards
The** leopards** found in Israel ([13:7](https://www.esv.org/Hosea+13%3A7/)) were probably Arabian leopards, which weighed only 50 to 60 pounds (23 to 27 kg). They were solitary hunters, eating mostly rabbits, lizards, and occasionally gazelles. Today, there are probably only a few dozen leopards inhabiting the desert regions of Israel.
