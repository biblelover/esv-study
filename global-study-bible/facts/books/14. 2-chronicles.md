# 2-Chronicles Facts

## #1: Kue
**Kue** ([1:16](https://www.esv.org/2+Chronicles+1%3A16/)) was a province located in what is today the nation of Turkey. It was a landlocked area, accessible only through two mountain passes. In NT times it was known as Cilicia and its chief city was Tarsus. Both the apostle Paul and the Roman orator Cicero were from this province.


## #2: Why did the pillars of the temple have names?
**Why did the pillars of the temple have names?** Jachin means “he establishes,” while Boaz means “in him is strength” ([3:17](https://www.esv.org/2+Chronicles+3%3A17/)). The names may have been a way of reminding worshipers that the Lord establishes his covenant through the temple.


## #3: What was the “sea” in the temple court?
**What was the “sea” in the temple court?** The sea ([4:2](https://www.esv.org/2+Chronicles+4%3A2/)) was a bronze water tank outside the southeast corner of the temple. The priests used it for ceremonial washing before entering the temple and to clean the area where sacrifices were made. It held at least 12,000 gallons (55,000 liters) of water.


## #4: Trumpets
**Trumpets** were important instruments in Israel ([7:6](https://www.esv.org/2+Chronicles+7%3A6/)). They were constructed from metals such as bronze, copper, silver, or gold. They were used for a variety of purposes, for instance, to gather the congregation and to announce festivals.


## #5: Which took longer to build: Solomon’s palace, or the temple?
**Which took longer to build: Solomon’s palace, or the temple?** Although Solomon spent seven years building the temple, he spent 13 years building his own palace ([8:1](https://www.esv.org/2+Chronicles+8%3A1/); [1 Kings 6:38; 7:1](https://www.esv.org/1+Kings+6%3A38%2C+7%3A1/)). This may have been an early sign that he was more devoted to his own causes than to the Lord.


## #6: Second Chronicles covers a span
**[Second Chronicles](https://www.esv.org/2+Chronicles+1%3A1%E2%80%9336%3A23/) covers a span** of more than 400 years and the reigns of 20 different kings.


## #7: Chief prince
The title of **chief prince** ([11:22–23](https://www.esv.org/2+Chronicles+11%3A22%E2%80%9323/)) was most likely an administrative position. Members of the royal family were sometimes appointed to such positions to help them learn how to lead a kingdom.


## #8: An unreported defeat?
**An unreported defeat?** Scholars believe that Zerah the Ethiopian ([14:9](https://www.esv.org/2+Chronicles+14%3A9/)), who suffered a humiliating defeat by King Asa, may have been fighting on behalf of Egypt. There is no record of the battle in Egyptian history, but that does not mean the defeat did not occur, since the Pharaohs did not always record their defeats.


## #9: Co-regency
**Co-regency** was the common practice of two kings ruling a country at the same time. The first king in the Bible to do this was David when he anointed his son Solomon to rule. Asa and Jehoshaphat reigned together for three years (chs. [16–17](https://www.esv.org/2+Chronicles+16%3A1%E2%80%9317%3A19/)). Co-regency allowed the son to learn from the father as he ruled. It also protected the throne from being claimed by another heir.


## #10: Ramoth-gilead
**Ramoth-gilead** was a commercial center and an important border town between Israel and Syria. This made it a prime target for capture. It had already changed hands several times between the two nations before the events described in ch. [18](https://www.esv.org/2+Chronicles+18%3A1%E2%80%9334/).


## #11: Tarshish
**Tarshish** ([20:36](https://www.esv.org/2+Chronicles+20%3A36/)) was a city at the western end of the Mediterranean Sea, possibly in Spain. It was famous for building ships to carry gold and silver to the Near East. Jonah tried to flee to Tarshish to avoid his responsibilities as a prophet.


## #12: Athaliah
**Athaliah** was the only woman to rule over Judah. She was the granddaughter of Omri and the daughter of Ahab. After seizing the throne and murdering the rest of the royal family, she reigned for six years before being overthrown. The young child Joash was hidden during her reign and became king after her death.


## #13: Why did the guards carry King David’s spears?
**Why did the guards carry King David’s spears?** Even though King David’s spears ([23:9](https://www.esv.org/2+Chronicles+23%3A9/)) were around 150 years old, they served an important purpose. Having the guards hold the spears at the coronation of Joash, who was only seven years old, symbolized his right to David’s throne.


## #14: Thistles
**Thistles** ([25:18](https://www.esv.org/2+Chronicles+25%3A18/)) are flowering plants known for their sharp outer edges. This discourages animals from feeding on the plant. In the Bible, thistles often represent God’s curse on the land.


## #15: Ten Hebrew kings
**Ten Hebrew kings** are mentioned among the records of the Assyrian Empire, which helps to show the reliability of biblical history. King Ahaz asked the Assyrians for help ([28:16](https://www.esv.org/2+Chronicles+28%3A16/)) but ended up becoming their servant ([28:20–21](https://www.esv.org/2+Chronicles+28%3A20%E2%80%9321/)).


## #16: What is a scapegoat?
**What is a scapegoat?** Laying hands on a sacrificial animal ([29:23–24](https://www.esv.org/2+Chronicles+29%3A23%E2%80%9324/)) was a symbolic act. It meant that human sin was being placed on the animal and taken away. On the Day of Atonement the people sacrificed a goat in this manner (see [Lev. 16:20–22](https://www.esv.org/Leviticus+16%3A20%E2%80%9322/)). Thus, today, when a person takes the blame for someone else, he or she may be referred to as a “scapegoat.”


## #17: Generous givers
**Generous givers.** When Hezekiah asked the people to contribute financially to his temple restoration project, they gave generously ([31:5](https://www.esv.org/2+Chronicles+31%3A5/)). Their response recalls the time of the tabernacle’s construction. The people gave so freely that Moses actually asked them to stop giving ([Ex. 36:3–7](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+36%3A3%E2%80%937/)).


## #18: Hezekiah’s wall
**Hezekiah’s wall** ([32:5](https://www.esv.org/2+Chronicles+32%3A5/)) was one of his many efforts to defend Jerusalem from the invading Assyrians. Archaeologists have uncovered a 650-foot (200-m)portion of this wall.


## #19: The Book of the Law of the Lord
**The Book of the Law of the Lord.** The high priest discovered this forgotten book while the temple was being repaired ([34:14](https://www.esv.org/2+Chronicles+34%3A14/)). After reading the Law, King Josiah called the nation to further measures of repentance and reform. The book may have included part or all of [Deuteronomy](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+1%3A1%E2%80%9334%3A12/).


## #20: Passover
**Passover** is a feast remembering Israel’s exodus from Egypt. It recalls their final meal in Egypt before deliverance. The most important element is the lamb ([Ex. 12:5](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+12%3A5/)). It reminds participants of the blood smeared on the doorposts to protect them from the plague of the firstborn. Bitter herbs are eaten with the lamb, symbolizing the bitterness of Egyptian captivity.


## #21: Exile to Babylon
**Exile to Babylon.** The people of Judah were deported to Babylon in four stages. In 605 b.c., Nebu­chad­nezzar defeated Jerusalem, carrying away treasures and some of the people. Daniel was taken to Babylon at this time. In 597, Babylon responded to rebellion in Jerusalem by defeating the city again. Ezekiel was taken into exile at this time. In 587, Babylon conquered Jerusalem for yet another rebellion. This time the Babylonians tore down the city’s defensive walls and destroyed the temple. Jeremiah experienced this defeat. Finally, in 582, while reasserting its control over Palestine, Babylon took more Israelites into captivity.
