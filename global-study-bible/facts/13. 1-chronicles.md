# 1-Chronicles Facts

## #1: Why begin with Adam?
**Why begin with Adam?** By beginning with Adam, the Chronicler shows that God planned to make Israel his chosen people, out of all the nations of the world, since the very beginning of human history.


## #2: Why so many genealogies?
**Why so many genealogies?** The first readers of [1 Chronicles](https://www.esv.org/1+Chronicles+1%3A1%E2%80%9329%3A30/) were Israelites living after the Babylo­nian exile. The genealogies showed them that they were still God’s people. For Christians, the genealogies also show how God preserved the line of David’s descendants that eventually led to Jesus the Messiah.


## #3: Do the books of Chronicles have a main theme?
**Do the books of Chronicles have a main theme?** The central theme of [1](https://www.esv.org/1+Chronicles+1%3A1%E2%80%9329%3A30/)–[2 Chronicles](https://www.esv.org/2+Chronicles+1%3A1%E2%80%9336%3A23/) is how God’s covenant with David provided an enduring hope for Israel, even in its darkest hours.


## #4: Bashan,
**Bashan,** northeast of the Sea of Galilee, was known for its rich pastureland and healthy livestock ([5:11–16](https://www.esv.org/1+Chronicles+5%3A11%E2%80%9316/)). The OT sometimes uses the riches of Bashan as a symbol of overindulgence and arrogance. For example, [Amos 4:1](https://www.esv.org/Amos+4%3A1/) refers to the proud, wealthy women of Samaria as “cows of Bashan.”


## #5: Why is the genealogy for Naphtali so short?
**Why is the genealogy for Naphtali so short?** The Chronicler was writing more than a thousand years after the beginning of Israel’s tribes. During that time, all the tribes had gone into exile. This made it difficult to find genealogies for all the tribes.

**How did David conquer Jerusalem?** The Chronicler tells of David’s conquest of Jerusalem in [11:4–10](https://www.esv.org/1+Chronicles+11%3A4%E2%80%9310/).

## #8: Bows and arrows
**Bows and arrows** were widely used in Bible times ([12:2](https://www.esv.org/1+Chronicles+12%3A2/)). Bows were made with single pieces of wood or by gluing layers of wood, horn, and sinew together. They were between 3 and 6 feet (0.9 and 1.8 m) long. Arrows were made of wood shafts or reeds that were tipped with metal heads. Bird feathers were added to guide the arrows.


## #9: Why couldn’t the ark be carried on an oxcart?
**Why couldn’t the ark be carried on an oxcart?** The Lord had commanded that the ark should be carried with long poles ([Ex. 25:12–15](https://www.esv.org/Exodus+25%3A12%E2%80%9315/)). Transporting the ark on an oxcart instead demonstrated a lack of reverence for this representation of God’s presence. When the oxen stumbled, Uzzah touched the ark to steady it, and the Lord struck him dead. Even those whose job it was to carry the ark were forbidden to touch it ([Num. 4:15](https://www.esv.org/Numbers+4%3A15/)).

The books of [1](https://www.esv.org/1+Chronicles+1%3A1%E2%80%9329%3A30/)–[2 Chronicles](https://www.esv.org/2+Chronicles+1%3A1%E2%80%9336%3A23/) agree that Israel sinned and suffered exile as a result. They also show that God still had a purpose for his people.


## #11: King David
